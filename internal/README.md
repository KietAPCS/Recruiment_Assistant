# Internal Folder

The `internal` folder contains code and resources that are intended for use only within this project. It is not designed to be imported or accessed by external projects or modules.

## Purpose

- Encapsulate project-specific logic and utilities.
- Maintain a clear separation between internal and external-facing code.
- Ensure modularity and prevent unintended dependencies.

## Guidelines

1. **Restricted Access**: Avoid exposing the contents of this folder to external packages.
2. **Project-Specific**: Keep all internal logic and helpers here to maintain a clean project structure.
3. **Testing**: Ensure all code in this folder is thoroughly tested to prevent internal bugs.

## Structure

Organize the folder as follows:

```
internal/
├── utils/          # Helper functions and utilities
├── services/       # Internal services and business logic
├── models/         # Data models specific to the project
└── README.md       # Documentation for the internal folder
```

## Notes

- Avoid placing reusable or shared code here; use a `pkg` or equivalent folder for that purpose.
- Regularly review and refactor the contents to ensure maintainability.
