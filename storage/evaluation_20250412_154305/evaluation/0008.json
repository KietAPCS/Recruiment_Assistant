    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates solid technical skills with experience in C, C++, and Python. They have worked with relevant tools and frameworks such as Visual Studio, Github, Cmake, and OpenCV. Their project experience, particularly with camera and LiDAR calibration and implementing MIXER logic, indicates a good understanding of software development principles. The candidate shows proficiency in applying deep learning models and working with point cloud and image data. However, the CV could benefit from more details on specific projects and technologies used to showcase the depth of their expertise. The CV showcases a strong foundation in programming languages and tools, and experience with relevant operating systems. The listed projects provide some validation of these skills, and the linked GitHub repositories could provide further evidence of coding abilities.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving and Analytical Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate shows problem-solving abilities through their work on implementing communication between ECUs, debugging issues, and developing solutions in their projects. Their experience with testing techniques like white-box and black-box testing also demonstrates analytical skills. The project descriptions, especially the Master Thesis project, highlight their ability to design and implement solutions for complex problems. However, the CV could be strengthened by providing more specific examples of challenges faced and how they were overcome. Based on the CV, there are good indications of analytical capabilities related to problem-solving. The description of thesis and research assistant project showcases an aptitude for independent analysis and problem solving.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Communication and Collaboration Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions cooperation with other developers, supporting customers, and teamwork. These points indicate that the candidate possesses communication and collaboration skills. However, the CV could benefit from providing more specific examples of how they effectively communicated technical concepts or collaborated in a team environment. The experiences listed suggest a willingness to engage and cooperate. Stronger evidence would be present with quantifiable instances of teamwork.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Experience",
      "explanation": "The candidate has approximately three years of experience as an Embedded System Software Developer at Bosch and research assistant experience at Aalto University. They have worked on projects involving machine learning, autonomous systems, and embedded systems. The projects are of a reasonable scope and complexity, demonstrating an understanding of software-engineer best practices. However, the CV could include more details on the impact and outcomes of these projects. Overall, the candidate's experience seems adequate for a mid-level software engineer role. The experience includes practical elements in real-world application, as well as academic and theoretical.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Object-Oriented Design (OOD)",
      "explanation": "While the CV mentions C++ and design of component architecture, it does not explicitly discuss OOD principles like inheritance, polymorphism, or encapsulation. Therefore, it's difficult to assess the candidate's understanding and use of OOD based solely on the CV. Evidence is suggestive of OOD understanding from the work, but not explicitly stated.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Code Quality and Testing",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions testing developed software using various techniques (white-box, black-box, etc.) and tools (HiL, SiL). This indicates an understanding of the need for rigorous testing. However, there is no mention of code reviews or test-driven development (TDD). It would be beneficial to know more about their approach to ensuring code quality. Based on information present, candidate has a reasonable process for testing and quality assurance.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Teamwork \u0026 Communication",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions cooperating with other developers, but it doesn't provide specific examples of how the candidate handled challenges or contributed to a team. The lack of detailed examples makes it difficult to fully assess their teamwork and communication skills. There is some suggestion the candidate can work with others, but is not explicit. More specific examples would lead to a better assessment.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Staying Current",
      "explanation": "The CV lists courses and technologies related to autonomous systems and machine learning, which indicates that the candidate is making an effort to stay current with industry trends. However, there's no mention of technical publications or specific resources they follow. Candidate is aware of some of the newer technologies.",
