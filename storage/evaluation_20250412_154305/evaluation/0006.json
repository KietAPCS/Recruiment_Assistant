    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates a strong understanding of several programming languages (Python, Java, C/C++, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Dart, Kotlin) and technologies/frameworks (GitHub, Nodejs, Bootstrap, SpringBoot, MongoDB, Docker, React Native). The projects listed showcase experience in web development, database management, and API implementation. The depth of knowledge appears adequate based on the project descriptions. However, the CV lacks specific details on the candidate's contributions and the complexity of the code written in each project. More detail is needed to push into a top score.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving and Analytical Skills",
      "explanation": "The project descriptions suggest an ability to analyze problems and develop solutions. For example, the Advertisement Management Website addresses the need for managing advertising placements with different user roles. Similarly, the Chat Application tackles real-time communication. However, the CV does not explicitly highlight problem-solving skills or the specific challenges faced and overcome during project development. The descriptions are more focused on features than on the problems that were solved.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Communication and Collaboration Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions responsibilities in each project, such as 'Designing UI using Figma, front-end and back-end side implementing, testing' and 'Product owner, FE + BE developer, architecture designer'. However, the CV lacks specific examples of communication or collaboration. The Extracurricular section mentions participation in GDSC Hackathon and Thach Thucâ€™s organization board, suggesting some teamwork experience, but details are missing. More information is needed to assess the candidate's ability to communicate effectively and work collaboratively.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Experience",
      "explanation": "The candidate is a Junior Student (as of September 2021) and has several projects listed. While the projects demonstrate practical experience with various technologies, they are likely academic or personal projects. The experience level is relatively limited, but the candidate's involvement in multiple projects showcases initiative. More clarity on the scale and complexity of these projects would be beneficial.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Object-Oriented Design (OOD)",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions 'Object-oriented programming' under Relevant Coursework, suggesting a theoretical understanding of OOD principles. The projects, particularly the Chat Application using Java and Spring Boot, imply the use of OOD concepts. However, the CV does not provide specific examples of how OOD principles were applied in practice. Without such details, it's difficult to assess the candidate's practical OOD skills beyond basic knowledge.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Code Quality and Testing",
      "explanation": "The 'Advertisement Management Website' description mentions 'testing' as a responsibility. However, the CV lacks details on the specific testing methodologies used (e.g., unit tests, integration tests, TDD). The absence of information regarding code reviews, debugging tools, or a systematic approach to quality assurance makes it difficult to evaluate the candidate's commitment to code quality.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Teamwork \u0026 Communication",
      "explanation": "The project descriptions mention responsibilities within teams, but the level of proactivity and specific examples of teamwork are not clearly articulated. The Extracurricular section mentions involvement in a hackathon and an organization, but the candidate's role and contributions within those teams are not detailed.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Staying Current",
      "explanation": "The candidate's skills list includes a range of modern technologies and frameworks, such as React Native, Docker, and SpringBoot, suggesting some awareness of current industry trends. However, the CV doesn't provide evidence of actively keeping up with technical publications or articulating trends. The listed skills could simply be technologies learned in coursework without deeper engagement.",
