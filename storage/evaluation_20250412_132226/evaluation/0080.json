    {
      "category": "Technical Skills and Experience",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates a basic understanding of several technical skills relevant to back-end development, including Python and SQL. However, the projects listed are primarily focused on data analysis and visualization, rather than back-end development tasks. The CV lacks details on experience with back-end frameworks, API design, or cloud computing, which are crucial for a back-end developer role. There is some evidence of SQL skills, but the depth of experience isn't clear. The candidate needs to showcase more back-end-specific experience to score higher.",

    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving and Analytical Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates analytical skills through projects involving data analysis and regression. The descriptions highlight the application of analytical techniques to solve business problems. However, the CV doesn't provide examples of solving complex problems specifically related to back-end development, such as optimizing database queries, troubleshooting API issues, or resolving scalability challenges. The projects showcase an ability to analyze data and derive insights, but not necessarily in a back-end context.",

      "category": "Teamwork and Communication Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate's volunteer experience shows some collaboration. The project descriptions include presenting findings, indicating communication skills. However, the CV lacks explicit examples of teamwork and communication within a development team. It's not clear how the candidate collaborates with other developers or communicates technical concepts to different audiences. More details on collaborative projects and communication strategies would improve the score.",

    {
      "category": "Continuous Learning and Adaptability",
      "explanation": "The candidate is currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree, indicating a commitment to learning. However, the CV lacks specific examples of continuous learning in the field of back-end development. There's no mention of online courses, certifications, or personal projects that demonstrate a proactive effort to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies. While the candidate's educational pursuits are commendable, more evidence of continuous learning in back-end development is needed.",
      "score": "4"
    },
    {
      "category": "Programming Languages Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions Python as a technical skill. The Regression Analysis project implies some coding experience. However, the level of proficiency is not clear. The CV lacks details on specific Python libraries or frameworks used. Without more information on the candidate's coding abilities, it's difficult to assess their proficiency beyond a basic level.",
      "score": "3"
