    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates a solid understanding of programming languages like Python and C/C++. Experience with tools and frameworks such as Visual Studio, Github, Cmake, and OpenCV is a plus. The projects mentioned showcase practical application of these skills, particularly in areas like deep learning and embedded systems. The candidate's experience with Autosar and embedded systems development is a strong point. However, the CV could benefit from more specific details on the depth of experience with each technology (e.g., specific versions, projects where they were used extensively). Overall, the candidate shows good technical proficiency for a software engineer role, especially in autonomous systems and machine learning applied to the automotive sector.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Problem Solving and Analytical Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions problem-solving in the context of debugging, analyzing reported problems, and implementing solutions in embedded systems and research projects. The project descriptions, particularly the Master Thesis and the MIXER project, suggest the ability to design, implement, and test complex systems, which implicitly require analytical skills. However, the CV lacks explicit examples of specific problem-solving scenarios or the application of particular analytical techniques. Including such examples would strengthen this category. The detail on debugging indicates problem-solving ability.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Communication and Collaboration",
      "explanation": "The candidate mentions teamwork, active listening, negotiation, and mentoring within their Bosch experience. Cooperating with other developers is explicitly stated. The research assistant roles also imply collaboration. The CV could be improved by providing specific examples of how the candidate effectively communicated technical ideas or resolved conflicts within a team setting. Also, more information would be needed to understand how well the candidate interacts with stakeholders.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Experience and Qualifications",
      "explanation": "The candidate has a Master's degree from Aalto University and is pursuing another one, along with three years of experience in the automotive sector with Bosch and experience as Research Assistant. The education is highly relevant, focusing on autonomous systems, machine learning, and embedded systems. The Bosch experience as an Embedded System Software Developer is particularly relevant. The projects listed, especially the Master Thesis, showcase practical experience in relevant areas. The candidate's background aligns well with software engineering roles in autonomous systems or the automotive industry. The information on education and professional experiences is very good.",
      "score": "8"
    },
    {
      "category": "Adaptability and Learning Agility",
      "explanation": "The candidate's pursuit of two Master's degrees and the focus on rapidly evolving fields like machine learning and autonomous systems demonstrate a willingness to learn. The candidate also shows experience using a variety of tools and frameworks, showing their adaptability. Explicit examples of adapting to changing priorities or learning new technologies quickly would further strengthen this area, but it can be inferred from the CV that the candidate is adaptable and willing to learn.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Code Quality and Testing",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions implementing communication between ECUs using Autosar and C language and testing developed software using official test techniques (white-box testing, black-box testing, range testing, MCDC,...) and tools such as HiL, SiL. The MIXER project also includes testing as a task. However, the CV lacks specifics on the candidate's understanding of code design principles or their experience with code reviews. Details about unit testing, integration testing, or static analysis would further enhance the evaluation.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "System Design",
      "explanation": "The candidate's involvement in the MIXER project includes 'design component structure.' The Master Thesis project also implies system design skills in the context of calibration pipelines. However, the CV lacks explicit details on the candidate's understanding of system architecture, distributed systems, databases, or networking. Providing more information on specific design decisions and the rationale behind them would significantly improve this assessment.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Teamwork and Collaboration",
      "explanation": "The CV explicitly mentions teamwork within the Bosch experience, as well as cooperating with other developers. The 'Skill gains' section lists teamwork, active listening, and negotiation. However, the candidate could provide specific examples of successful teamwork experiences, such as conflict resolution or contributions to team goals.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Domain Knowledge",
      "explanation": "The candidate has three years of experience in the automotive sector and expresses a deep understanding of the industry's characteristics, development processes, and challenges. The focus on machine learning applications within the automotive domain demonstrates relevant domain knowledge. Mentioning familiarity with specific industry standards or regulations would further strengthen this.",
      "score": "4"
    },
    {
      "category": "Continuous Learning",
      "explanation": "The candidate's ongoing pursuit of a Master's degree and active involvement in research projects demonstrate a commitment to continuous learning. The 'Skill gains' sections in the education descriptions also show that they are always learning new technologies. Listing specific professional development activities or participation in industry events would provide additional evidence of continuous learning.",
