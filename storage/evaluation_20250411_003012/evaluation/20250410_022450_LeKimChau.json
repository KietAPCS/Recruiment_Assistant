      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "Kim demonstrates proficiency in several relevant technologies, including C++, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Reactjs, and TailwindCSS. The projects showcase practical application of these skills, particularly in frontend development. The inclusion of Figma indicates design skills, which is a plus. The depth of knowledge in each technology isn't fully evident, but the breadth is promising for a candidate with the expected graduation date of 2027. Scores could be improved with demonstrable evidence of coding quality and system design understanding.",

      "category": "Problem Solving and Analytical Skills",
      "explanation": "The project descriptions provide some insight into Kim's problem-solving abilities. The 'Health Recommendation System' and 'TikTok TechJam' projects suggest an ability to analyze user needs and develop solutions. The description of enhancing Tailored Discovery for TikTok shop indicates some analytical thinking. However, the level of complexity of problems tackled isn't clear, and more detail on the problem-solving process would be beneficial. The involvement in the Chess Club hints at strategic thinking, but this is not directly related to software engineering problem-solving.",

      "category": "Communication and Collaboration",
      "explanation": "Kim's involvement in the Google Developer Group and the Chess Club demonstrates some communication and collaboration skills. The description of the Web Specialist role suggests experience in tech-sharing workshops, which requires effective communication. Organizing an eSport tournament further suggests communication and organizational abilities. More concrete examples of teamwork and collaborative problem-solving in a software development context would strengthen this area.",

      "category": "Adaptability and Learning Agility",
      "explanation": "The range of technologies and projects Kim has worked on suggests a willingness to learn. The EvoGym project, described as a tutorial project, shows the candidate's willingness to learn from available resources. Actively participating in Google Developer Group also suggests an interest in new technologies. However, the CV lacks specific examples of adapting to changing requirements or quickly mastering new concepts in a challenging situation.",

      "category": "Experience",
      "explanation": "Kim has several frontend development projects listed, demonstrating practical experience with React, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript. While the projects seem relatively short-term, they provide relevant experience. The 'TikTok TechJam' project is the most impressive, suggesting experience with dynamic theming and responsive design. However, there is no mention of experience in public safety or public health software, which is considered a bonus. Given the expected graduation date, the listed experience is a good start.",
