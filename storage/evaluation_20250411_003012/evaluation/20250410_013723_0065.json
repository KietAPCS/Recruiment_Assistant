    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates proficiency in various software and fabrication tools relevant to architectural design and digital fabrication. The candidate's experience as a Digital Fabrication Lab Technician and Representation Intern suggests a familiarity with technologies like Adobe Creative Suite, Rhinoceros, Revit, AutoCAD, and various fabrication techniques. However, the CV lacks specific examples of coding skills or software development experience typically expected for a software engineer role. The listed skills are more geared towards design and fabrication rather than software engineering. Therefore, the score is moderate.",

    {
      "category": "Problem Solving and Analytical Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions diagnosing equipment issues at the Pratt Interdisciplinary Technology Lab, which implies some problem-solving skills. Additionally, assisting with internal and personal assessments suggests analytical abilities. However, the descriptions are vague, and there's a lack of specific examples demonstrating complex problem-solving in a software engineering context. The candidate's role as an event staff and photography assistant provide less insights into analytical skills relevant to the role.",

    {
      "category": "Experience",
      "explanation": "The candidate's experience is primarily in architecture, design, and fabrication, with roles such as Digital Fabrication Lab Technician, Representation Intern, Event Services Staff and Photography Assistant. While these roles demonstrate valuable skills like problem-solving and teamwork, they lack direct relevance to software engineering. There is no mention of experience in public safety or public health software, as per the job description's preference. Therefore, the score is relatively low due to the lack of relevant professional experience.",
