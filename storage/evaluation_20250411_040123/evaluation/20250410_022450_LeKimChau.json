    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving and Analytical Skills",
      "explanation": "The projects showcase problem-solving skills, particularly in the TikTok TechJam project where they enhanced Tailored Discovery by extracting user preferences. The description of analyzing chess openings and strategies in the Chess Club also demonstrates analytical skills. More details on the specific technical challenges faced and how they were overcome in each project would further strengthen this area.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and Best Practices",
      "explanation": "The CV doesn't explicitly mention SDLC methodologies. However, the project descriptions suggest an understanding of development processes. Information regarding testing methodologies, version control, and CI/CD pipelines is missing. Detailing their experience with these practices would significantly improve this category.",

    },
    {
      "category": "Code Quality and Maintainability",
      "explanation": "The CV does not include code samples, making it difficult to assess code quality and maintainability.

Providing links to GitHub repositories or describing specific coding standards followed would improve this evaluation.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Testing and Debugging",
