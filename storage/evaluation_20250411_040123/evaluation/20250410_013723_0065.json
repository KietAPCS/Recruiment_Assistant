    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate lists skills relevant to architectural design and digital fabrication, including Rhinoceros, Grasshopper, Revit, AutoCAD, Adobe Creative Suite, and various fabrication tools (laser cutting, 3D printing, CNC milling). However, the CV lacks mention of core software engineering technologies like C#, .NET, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java, Python, and C++. The experience as a Digital Fabrication Lab Technician suggests some technical aptitude, but it's focused on equipment operation and support rather than software development. Therefore, the candidate's technical proficiency related to software engineering appears limited based on the provided information. More information would be needed to properly evaluate software engineering skills.",
      "score": "2"
    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving and Analytical Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV provides limited direct evidence of problem-solving and analytical skills in a software engineering context. Diagnosing equipment issues as a Digital Fabrication Lab Technician suggests some problem-solving ability, but the specific nature of these problems and the solutions implemented are not detailed. The descriptions of the roles (Event Services Staff, Representation Intern, Photography Assistant) do not provide concrete examples of analytical or problem-solving abilities. The role in the digital lab is most relevant but lacks detail.",

    {
      "category": "Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and Best Practices",
      "explanation": "There is no explicit mention of SDLC methodologies, coding standards, testing practices, or version control systems in the CV. The candidate's experience does not appear to involve formal software development processes. Therefore, it's difficult to assess their understanding or adherence to SDLC principles and software engineering best practices based on the provided information.",
      "score": "1"
    },
    {
      "category": "Collaboration and Communication Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate emphasizes being an 'outgoing and optimistic teamplayer' and mentions creating 'strong bonds' when working with others. The experience as Event Services Staff and Representation Intern involves interacting with guests, colleagues, and clients, suggesting some level of communication skills. Assisting as a translator also indicates communication abilities. However, the CV lacks specific examples of technical communication or collaborative projects in a software engineering context.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Adaptability and Learning Agility",
      "explanation": "The candidate states being 'ready to engage and absorb new knowledge and criticisms'. The diverse experiences listed in the CV, ranging from event services to digital fabrication, suggest some degree of adaptability. However, there's no specific evidence of adapting to new technologies or methodologies in a software engineering context. The candidate is an undergraduate student, which implies some willingness to learn.",
      "score": "5"

    {
      "category": "Code Quality and Maintainability",
      "explanation": "There is no mention of coding or software development in the CV. Therefore, it is impossible to evaluate code quality and maintainability.",
