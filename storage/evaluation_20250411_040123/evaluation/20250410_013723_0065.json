    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates skills in visualization, modeling, and fabrication, with experience in software like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Lightroom, V-Ray, Enscape, Rhinoceros-Grasshopper, Revit, and AutoCAD. They also have experience with fabrication tools like laser cutting, ZUND digital cutting and routing, WAZER waterjet, 3D printing and scanning, and CNC milling. However, the CV lacks mention of common software engineering technologies such as C#, .NET, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java, Python, or C++. Given the focus on architectural design and digital fabrication, the technical skills are relevant but not directly aligned with software engineering. The score reflects the relevant technical skills in design software and digital fabrication, but the absence of core software engineering technologies limits the score.",

      "category": "Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and Best Practices",
      "explanation": "The CV lacks information regarding the candidate's understanding of SDLC methodologies, coding standards, testing practices, and version control systems. There's no mention of experience with Agile, Waterfall, CI/CD pipelines, or any software engineering best practices. Therefore, it's difficult to assess their knowledge in this area, leading to a low score.",
      "score": "2"
    },
    {
      "category": "Collaboration and Communication Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate's CV emphasizes teamwork and communication through roles like Event Services Staff, Representation Intern, and involvement in student organizations (NOMAS Pratt Chapter, Vietnamese Students Association). They organized events, assisted in producing visualization materials, participated in meetings with foreign clients (as a translator), guided students, and contributed to lectures. These experiences highlight the ability to work in a team, communicate effectively, and collaborate with diverse groups. This shows strong collaboration and communication skills, making them an effective team player.",
