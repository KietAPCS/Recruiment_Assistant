    {
      "category": "Communication and Interpersonal Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates effective communication through their involvement in various organizations and projects, particularly in roles like International Ambassador and Vice-President of the Vietnamese Student Association. Their experience in providing support to students, translating documents, and planning events showcases their ability to communicate effectively and build relationships. However, the CV lacks specific examples of handling challenging client interactions or resolving conflicts. Therefore, while there's evidence of good communication, it doesn't fully align with the Account Executive's need for conflict resolution expertise.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Account Management and Organizational Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate's experiences, such as International Ambassador, showcase some organizational skills through event planning and support for students. The role as Vice-President, focusing on event planning and day-to-day operations, further suggests organizational abilities. However, there's no mention of CRM software experience or direct account management. The CV would benefit from examples of managing tasks, prioritizing deadlines, or specific tools used for organization.",
      "score": "5"
    },
    {
      "category": "Revenue Generation and Upselling Ability",
      "explanation": "The CV does not provide any direct evidence of revenue generation or upselling abilities. While the candidate designed promotional materials for a fundraising event ('Pho Night'), the CV doesn't quantify the event's success or the candidate's specific contribution to revenue goals. The CV is missing any instances where the candidate identified growth opportunities or presented business cases. Therefore, based on the information available, it's difficult to assess this skill.",
      "score": "2"

    {
      "category": "Industry Knowledge and Adaptability",
      "explanation": "The CV suggests industry knowledge related to graphic design and visual communication, as demonstrated through projects like the 'Typography Glossary Book Design' and 'CoPee Truck Brand Identity.' However, there is no explicit indication of the candidate's understanding of the Account Executive's industry. The candidate's experiences demonstrate adaptability through involvement in diverse activities and organizations, but specific examples related to adapting to client needs or industry changes are missing.",
      "score": "4"
    },
    {
      "category": "CRM Software Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The CV does not mention any experience with CRM software. The candidate lists software skills such as Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, XD, and Figma, but no CRM tools like Salesforce, HubSpot, or Zoho are mentioned. This is a significant gap in terms of the requirements for an Account Executive role.",
      "score": "1"
    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving Skills",
      "explanation": "While the CV highlights various projects and responsibilities, there are limited explicit examples of problem-solving skills. The candidate's role as International Ambassador involved addressing student needs, which implicitly requires some problem-solving, but specific instances of analyzing complex problems and developing effective solutions are not detailed. The CV could be strengthened by including examples of challenges faced and how the candidate overcame them.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Negotiation Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV lacks evidence of negotiation skills. The candidate's experiences primarily focus on design and event planning, without mentioning any instances of negotiating contracts, resolving disputes, or managing client expectations. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is not possible to assess the candidate's negotiation skills.",
      "score": "1"

    {
      "category": "Travel Willingness",
      "explanation": "The CV does not explicitly state the candidate's willingness to travel. Therefore, it's not possible to assess this aspect based on the provided information. However, it could be assumed, given the fact that the education is not online, that the candidate is willing to commute.",
      "score": "2"
    },
    {
      "category": "Budget Management",
      "explanation": "The CV does not provide any specific examples of budget management. While the candidate was involved in fundraising events, there's no mention of managing budgets, tracking expenses, or ensuring cost-effectiveness. Therefore, based on the information available, it's difficult to assess this skill.",
