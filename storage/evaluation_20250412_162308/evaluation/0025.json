      "explanation": "Huu demonstrates solid communication skills through experiences like assisting in sales meetings and presenting data-driven insights. The resume highlights involvement in coordinating events and workshops, suggesting an ability to work with and communicate to diverse groups. However, the resume lacks specific examples of handling challenging clients or resolving conflicts, which are crucial for an Account Executive role. More detail on how he built rapport or managed difficult conversations would strengthen this area.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Account Management and Organizational Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate showcases good organizational skills through experiences such as Operation Analyst at Watchfinder\u0026Co, where he inspected data for 50 watches weekly and processed 20 manifests daily. This demonstrates the ability to handle large volumes of data and manage inventory. His involvement in event planning and coordination further supports his organizational abilities. However, the resume does not explicitly mention experience with CRM software, which is a key requirement. Adding details about any CRM tools used, even in academic projects, would improve this section.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Revenue Generation and Upselling Ability",
      "explanation": "The resume doesn't directly address revenue generation or upselling. While he mentions aiding in achieving annual sales targets as an Operation Analyst, the contribution is not quantified or directly linked to upselling efforts. The portfolio projects focus on data analysis and insights, but lack a clear connection to driving revenue growth. Adding examples of how his analysis led to increased sales or identified upselling opportunities would be highly beneficial.",

      "category": "Industry Knowledge and Adaptability",
      "explanation": "Huu demonstrates industry knowledge through his educational background in Fashion Business Management and Business Analytics. He also highlights interests in Technology, Artificial Intelligence, Fashion, and Sustainability. The projects show application of data analytics skills in various contexts, suggesting adaptability. However, the resume does not explicitly demonstrate staying current with industry trends or adapting to changing client needs. Including examples of how he has adapted to new situations or learned new skills quickly would enhance this section.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "CRM Software Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The resume does not mention any direct experience with CRM software like Salesforce or HubSpot. While he possesses strong data analysis skills, the absence of CRM experience is a significant gap. Even mentioning familiarity with CRM concepts learned in coursework would be beneficial.",
      "score": "1"
    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving Skills",
      "explanation": "The portfolio projects strongly highlight his problem-solving skills. The NYC Subway Crime Analysis, for instance, demonstrates his ability to analyze data, identify problems (crime hotspots), and propose solutions (resource allocation). Other projects showcase similar analytical and problem-solving abilities. These examples provide strong evidence of his capacity to identify and solve complex problems using data-driven approaches.",
      "score": "4"
    },
    {
      "category": "Negotiation Skills",
      "explanation": "The resume provides no explicit evidence of negotiation skills. While his experience in merchandising and marketing may have involved some level of negotiation, it is not stated. Including examples of how he has successfully negotiated outcomes in professional or academic settings would greatly improve this area.",
      "score": "1"
    },
    {
      "category": "Travel Willingness",

    {
      "category": "Budget Management",
      "explanation": "The resume provides no specific examples of budget management. While his experience as an Operation Analyst may have touched on cost control, this is not explicitly stated. Including examples of how he has managed budgets, tracked expenses, or ensured cost-effectiveness would be beneficial.",
