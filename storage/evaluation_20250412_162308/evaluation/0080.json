    {
      "category": "Communication and Interpersonal Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate provides some evidence of communication skills through project presentations and volunteer experience, particularly in collaborative environments. However, the CV lacks specific examples of building client relationships or resolving conflicts, which are critical for an account executive role.

    },
    {
      "category": "Account Management and Organizational Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV demonstrates project management skills through the described projects, highlighting the ability to analyze data, identify trends, and present findings.

      "explanation": "The CV does not provide any information about revenue generation or upselling experience.
