      "explanation": "Huu demonstrates adequate communication skills through the description of their experiences, showcasing the ability to present data-driven insights and coordinate events. The CV provides examples of collaboration and communication within team settings. However, the CV lacks direct examples of conflict resolution and persuasive communication, which would strengthen the evaluation. Therefore, a score of 6 is appropriate.",

    {
      "category": "Client Relationship Management",
      "explanation": "The CV lacks explicit examples of direct client relationship management. While there is mention of assisting in sales meetings and communicating data-driven insights to buyers, these do not highlight building or maintaining client relationships. The roles primarily seem focused on internal analysis and support, so it's difficult to assess the candidate's client relationship management skills based on this CV. Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate.",

      "category": "Problem-Solving and Analytical Skills",
      "explanation": "Huu demonstrates strong problem-solving and analytical skills through their portfolio projects and experiences. Examples include analyzing subway crime data, optimizing brand engagement, and building a stock price pipeline.

    {
      "category": "Organizational and Time Management Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV indicates adequate organizational and time management skills. The candidate has managed multiple projects, coordinated events, and processed manifests, implying some ability to prioritize tasks and manage time. However, there is a lack of specific details on how they managed multiple accounts or prioritized tasks under pressure. Therefore, a score of 6 is appropriate.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Sales and Revenue Generation",
      "explanation": "The CV provides limited evidence of direct sales and revenue generation skills. While the Operation Analyst role at Watchfinder\u0026Co mentions aiding in achieving annual sales targets, the candidate's direct contribution to sales is not explicitly stated. Similarly, the Merchandising \u0026 Marketing Coordinator role involved supporting event planning and promotions, but not necessarily driving revenue. The candidate requires additional information to confirm a sales background to properly assess this skill, thus a score of 3.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "CRM Software Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The CV does not explicitly mention CRM software proficiency. While it lists various technical skills, including SQL, Python, and AWS, it does not include experience with specific CRM software like Zoho, HubSpot, or Salesforce. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the candidate's familiarity with CRM systems. The candidate's data driven approach is seen through the portfolio section, a score of 2.",
      "score": "2"
    },
    {
      "category": "Upselling and Cross-selling Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV does not provide any information on upselling or cross-selling skills. There are no examples of identifying opportunities to upsell or cross-sell to existing clients. The experiences listed are more focused on data analysis and operational support. So a score of 1 is appropriate.",

      "category": "Prioritization and Focus",
      "explanation": "The CV demonstrates adequate prioritization and focus through the management of multiple projects and coordination of events. The candidate's involvement in various initiatives suggests the ability to prioritize tasks and stay focused on key objectives. However, there is a lack of specific examples of how they maintain motivation on less interesting accounts or tasks. Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate.",
      "score": "3"

    {
      "category": "Conflict Resolution",
      "explanation": "The CV does not offer specific examples of conflict resolution. While it highlights communication and collaboration skills, it lacks instances of handling challenging clients or resolving conflicts professionally. The descriptions of the roles focus more on analysis and coordination rather than direct client interaction. Therefore, a score of 2 is appropriate.",
