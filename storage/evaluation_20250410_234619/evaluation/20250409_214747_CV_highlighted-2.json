    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates a strong foundation in relevant technologies, particularly Java, Spring Boot, JavaScript, TypeScript, Next.js, and PostgreSQL. Their project descriptions highlight practical application of these technologies, including database management, API development, and front-end development with modern frameworks. The projects show experience with JWT authentication, caching with Redis, and cloud messaging with Firebase. The listed coursework also indicates a solid understanding of fundamental concepts like data structures, algorithms, and database systems.  However, there is no mention of C# or .NET, which are listed as required technologies, represents a gap. Furthermore, there is no evidence of hands-on expertise with required tools and languages in the public safety domain, which would improve the score.",

    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving and Troubleshooting Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates problem-solving skills through their project descriptions, particularly in optimizing server load efficiency using debounce, implementing security measures, and utilizing caching to enhance response times. Participation in competitive programming and algorithm competitions further supports their problem-solving abilities. The explanation of the projects shows how the candidate addresses performance and scaling problems in the developed applications.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Expertise",
      "explanation": "The project descriptions indicate experience in the development and implementation phases of the SDLC. The candidate mentions technologies and approaches aligned with modern software development practices. They have worked on both personal and group projects, likely exposing them to different aspects of SDLC. While the CV doesn't explicitly state experience in all phases of the SDLC (planning, analysis, design, maintenance), the level of detail in describing the project implementations points towards a solid understanding. However, there isn't explicit mention of Agile methodologies, so this represents a gap.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Communication and Collaboration Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate's participation in group projects (FoodHub) and team-based problem-solving exercises (UIT - ACM/ICPC BootCamp) suggests good collaboration skills. The detailed project descriptions, including the technologies used and features implemented, indicate an ability to communicate technical information. However, the CV lacks specific examples of communicating with non-technical audiences or resolving conflicts within a team.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Customer Focus and Service Orientation",
      "explanation": "The project descriptions for OptiMart and FoodHub demonstrate a focus on user experience, such as implementing advanced search functionality and optimizing server load efficiency. This suggests an understanding of customer needs and a desire to improve user satisfaction. However, the CV does not explicitly mention customer interaction or feedback, so the assessment is based on inferred customer focus from the project features.",
