    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates skills relevant to architectural design, digital fabrication, and visualization. However, there is a lack of explicit mention of core software engineering technologies such as C#, .NET, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, or CSS. The skills listed (Adobe Suite, Rhino, AutoCAD, etc.) are more aligned with design and fabrication rather than software development. Therefore, the technical proficiency regarding software engineering appears limited based on the provided CV. There is also no mention of database experience.",

    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving and Troubleshooting Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate's experience as a Digital Fabrication Lab Technician suggests some troubleshooting abilities related to equipment and software. Diagnosing issues with digital cutting, robotics, 3D scanning, and AI equipment implies problem-solving skills. Assisting students with software issues as a Photography Assistant also indicates problem-solving. However, these experiences are not directly related to software engineering problem-solving. The resume needs more examples of debugging or code-related problem-solving.",

      "category": "Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Expertise",
      "explanation": "There's no explicit evidence of experience with the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) or Agile methodologies in the CV. The roles described do not inherently involve software development processes. Therefore, the candidate's understanding and experience in this area appear limited. The CV does not highlight planning, analysis, design, development, implementation, or maintenance activities related to software.",

As an Event Services Staff, the candidate interacted with guests and provided information, demonstrating service orientation. Aiding students with software and photo-taking as a Photography Assistant indicates a commitment to helping others.
