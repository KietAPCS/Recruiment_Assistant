    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates proficiency in several programming languages (C++, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript) and frameworks/tools (Reactjs, TailwindCSS, Figma). The projects listed provide practical experience using these technologies in frontend development. The candidate's coursework in Computer Science also strengthens their technical foundation. However, there is no mention of C# or .NET, and SQL or database technologies are not explicitly stated. Because these are required technologies as stated in the prompt, I deducted some points. Overall, the candidate is skilled in technologies that they mentioned in the resume.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving and Troubleshooting Skills",
      "explanation": "The resume provides some insight into the candidate's problem-solving skills through project descriptions. For example, enhancing 'Tailored Discovery for TikTok shop' and 'integrating Magic UI library for some modern animated components' suggest the ability to identify and implement solutions. The description of analyzing chess openings and strategies demonstrates logical reasoning. However, the resume lacks specific examples of troubleshooting complex technical issues or debugging code, so I've deducted some points as a result.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Expertise",
      "explanation": "The candidate has experience in the design and development phases of the SDLC, as shown in the project descriptions involving Figma for UI design and React/TailwindCSS for implementation. The 'Health Recommendation System' and 'TikTok TechJam 2024' projects show experience in planning. There's no explicit mention of experience in all phases of SDLC or agile methodologies, which is a weakness. So, based on the information provided, SDLC expertise is adequately demonstrated within the project scopes described.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Communication and Collaboration Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate's involvement in the Google Developer Group as a Web Specialist and the HCMUS Chess Club suggests good communication and collaboration skills. Organizing a tournament further highlights these abilities. The resume demonstrates teamwork through project work and leadership through the tournament organizer role. The description of assisting in teaching basic chess concepts indicates an ability to explain concepts. However, the resume lacks specific examples of conflict resolution or communication with non-technical audiences, so I've deducted some points as a result.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Customer Focus and Service Orientation",
      "explanation": "The 'Health Recommendation System' project implies some understanding of customer needs (users with health problems). However, the resume doesn't explicitly focus on customer service or satisfaction. There aren't any examples of going above and beyond to meet customer needs or handling difficult situations. Therefore, I've provided a low score.",
      "score": "4"
    },
    {
      "category": "Code Quality and Maintainability",
      "explanation": "There's no direct information on code quality or maintainability in the resume. The resume mentions using TypeScript for better type handling, which indicates some concern for code quality. However, there's no discussion of coding standards, design patterns, or unit tests.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Database Management Skills",
      "explanation": "The resume lacks any explicit mention of database management skills, SQL, or database technologies. While some projects might implicitly involve databases, this isn't stated.",
      "score": "1"
    },
    {
      "category": "Web Technologies Expertise",
      "explanation": "The candidate shows strong web technologies expertise through the use of JavaScript, TypeScript, React, TailwindCSS, and Figma in several projects. These projects demonstrate practical experience in developing responsive web applications and designing UIs. The description of implementing dynamic theming further supports this.",
      "score": "4"
    },
    {
      "category": "Learning Agility",
      "explanation": "The candidate's willingness to learn new technologies is implied by the use of different frameworks and tools across various projects. The projects show an eagerness to apply new concepts. Being part of the Google Developer Group implies an interest in staying current with industry trends. However, there are no specific examples of quickly grasping new concepts or adapting to rapidly changing requirements.",
      "score": "4"
