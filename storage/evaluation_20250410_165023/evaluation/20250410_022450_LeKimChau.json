    {
      "category": "Technical Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates proficiency in several programming languages (C++, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript) and frameworks/tools (Reactjs, TailwindCSS, Figma). This is showcased through project experience. However, the CV lacks specific accounting software skills (e.g., QuickBooks, Xero) crucial for a staff accountant role. Therefore, while strong in programming, the relevance to accounting is limited.",
      "score": "5"
    },
    {
      "category": "Work Experience",
      "explanation": "The candidate's work experience primarily revolves around frontend developer roles in various projects, including a health recommendation system, TikTok TechJam, and EvoGym. While these projects demonstrate technical skills and teamwork, they lack direct relevance to accounting functions. The candidate does not provide any experience in finance.",
      "score": "2"
    },
    {
      "category": "Education",
      "explanation": "The candidate is currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. While a strong academic record (GPA 3.76/4.00) is evident, the field of study is not directly related to accounting. The candidate's high school education shows good grades and an IELTS score, but also lacks accounting-specific relevance. The education is good, but not applicable to the staff-accountant role.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Leadership",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates some leadership through involvement in the Google Developer Group and as a Tournament Organizer. However, the scope and impact of these roles are not clearly defined in terms of measurable outcomes relevant to the staff accountant position. There are some leadership experiences, but none of them have relevance to the job.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Communication",
      "explanation": "The CV indirectly suggests communication skills through project descriptions and involvement in student organizations. However, there is no explicit mention of public speaking, writing samples, or specific examples of effective collaboration. The candidate has described leadership and involment, which could imply communication.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Problem Solving",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions the use of AI in the health recommendation system and dynamic theming in the TikTok TechJam project, which indicates some problem-solving skills. However, these examples are not directly related to accounting or financial challenges. More accounting problem solving skills needs to be demonstrated for a relevant evaluation.",
