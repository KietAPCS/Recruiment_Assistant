    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "Kim demonstrates proficiency in several relevant technologies, including C++, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Reactjs, TailwindCSS, and Figma. The projects showcase practical application of these technologies in frontend development. The coursework mentions relevant subjects like OOP and Data Structures. While SQL and .NET aren't explicitly mentioned, the overall skill set aligns well with software engineering roles focusing on frontend development. Further details on database experience would be beneficial.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving and Analytical Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV provides some evidence of problem-solving through project descriptions (e.g., enhancing tailored discovery for TikTok shop) and involvement in the chess club, where analyzing strategies is key. The health recommendation system also suggests analytical skills. However, the descriptions lack depth regarding specific problem-solving approaches or challenges overcome. More detailed examples would strengthen this section.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Expertise",
      "explanation": "The project descriptions imply involvement in some phases of the SDLC, particularly development and design (using Figma). The Google Developer Group role suggests some exposure to project planning and execution. However, there's no explicit mention of requirements gathering, testing methodologies, or deployment processes. Experience with agile methodologies or continuous integration isn't mentioned. The description could be improved by explicitly stating involvement in different SDLC stages.",
      "score": "5"
    },
    {
      "category": "Communication and Collaboration Skills",
      "explanation": "The projects indicate collaboration with teams, and the Google Developer Group role involves tech-sharing workshops, suggesting communication skills. Organizing the eSport tournament also demonstrates leadership and organizational abilities. However, the descriptions are brief, and lack specific examples of conflict resolution or effective communication strategies used. Strengthening this section with detailed instances of teamwork and communication would be beneficial.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Code Quality and Testing",
      "explanation": "The CV does not provide information about code quality and testing practices. There is no mention of unit tests, integration tests, or any testing methodologies. The absence of this information makes it difficult to assess the candidate's ability to write clean, maintainable, and well-tested code. Providing code samples or detailing testing experience would significantly improve this area.",
      "score": "2"
    },
    {
      "category": "Continuous Learning and Professional Development",
      "explanation": "The candidate's active involvement in the Google Developer Group and participation in multiple projects suggest a willingness to learn and grow. The candidate is currently a student, so there isn't much professional history to demonstrate continuous learning, but the activities so far are promising. Further detail about self-directed learning or specific technologies learned independently would strengthen this section.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Adaptability and Flexibility",
      "explanation": "The candidate's participation in multiple projects with varying focuses and technologies demonstrates some adaptability and flexibility. The TikTok TechJam project, in particular, suggests the ability to work under pressure and adapt to new challenges. Further examples of dealing with ambiguous requirements or tight deadlines would reinforce this assessment.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Public Safety/Public Health Domain Knowledge",
      "explanation": "The candidate's CV does not mention any specific experience or projects related to the public safety or public health domains. The Health Recommendation System project is health-*adjacent*, but does not suggest any specialized knowledge in the field.",
