    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates proficiency in several relevant languages including C++, C#, Java, and Python. They also have experience with multiple frameworks such as Unity, Qt5, Spring Boot, and Django. The listed developer tools (Git, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code) and libraries (SFML) are also pertinent to the role. The variety of technologies suggests a well-rounded understanding, but depth in each area is hard to determine without more specifics.",
      "score": "8"
    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving and Debugging Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV provides evidence of problem-solving skills through projects such as the Parser \u0026 Computer Algebra System and the Underwater Physic Engine. These projects involve complex algorithms and simulations, indicating the candidate's ability to tackle challenging problems. The description of debugging in the context of API development and traffic simulation further supports this. However, specific examples of debugging complex issues could strengthen this section.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Collaboration and Communication Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate's experience as a Programming Mentor suggests good communication skills, particularly in explaining technical concepts. The Software Development Intern role implies collaboration within a team environment. However, the CV lacks specific examples of teamwork or communication challenges the candidate has overcome. Detailing contributions to team projects and communication strategies would be beneficial.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Continuous Learning and Adaptability",
      "explanation": "The candidate's engagement in diverse projects (Parser, Physics Engine, Traffic Simulator) and frameworks demonstrates adaptability and a willingness to learn new technologies. The certifications and awards further indicate a commitment to continuous learning. Actively contributing to open-source projects or mentioning specific learning resources would further enhance this section.",
      "score": "8"
    },
    {
      "category": "HTML/CSS Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The CV doesn't explicitly mention HTML/CSS. Given the focus on C++, C#, Java, and backend frameworks, it's possible the candidate has limited experience with front-end technologies. This is a weakness since the role requires web development skills.",
      "score": "1"
    },
    {
      "category": "JavaScript Proficiency",
      "explanation": "Similar to HTML/CSS, there is no direct mention of JavaScript proficiency. This is a significant gap, considering the role involves web development and the importance of JavaScript for interactivity.",
      "score": "1"
    },
    {
      "category": "Backend Technologies (PHP, SQL) Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate has experience with SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL) as indicated under 'Developer Tools' and 'Experience', where they developed RESTful APIs using Spring MVC and handled databases. However, PHP is not mentioned. The experience with Spring MVC and database management systems is a plus.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Version Control (Git) Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate lists Git under 'Developer Tools', which indicates familiarity. However, the extent of their proficiency is not clear. Including specific examples of how they've used Git for collaboration, branching, or conflict resolution would be beneficial.",
