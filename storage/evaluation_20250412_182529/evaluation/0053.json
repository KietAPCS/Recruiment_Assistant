      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate's resume showcases experience with technical tools like MATLAB, LabView, and SolidWorks, which are relevant for engineering tasks but not directly for web development. There is no mention of web development-specific languages such as C#, C++, Objective-C, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, or SQL. The projects listed are focused on biomedical engineering and lack any web development context. Therefore, the candidate's technical proficiency in web development is limited based on the information provided.",

      "category": "Problem-Solving and Debugging Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates problem-solving skills through projects like designing a heart rate monitor and an external fixator. These projects involve identifying problems, developing solutions, and testing prototypes. However, the resume does not provide specific examples of debugging software or resolving code-related issues. While the engineering projects imply a level of problem-solving aptitude, its direct applicability to software debugging in a web development context is not evident.",

      "explanation": "The candidate's academic background and involvement in various engineering projects suggest a willingness to learn and adapt. The candidate has pursued a Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering and participated in projects involving different technologies. However, the resume does not explicitly mention any efforts to learn web development technologies or stay up-to-date with industry trends in that specific field. While the candidate demonstrates a capacity for learning, the focus is on biomedical engineering rather than web development.",
