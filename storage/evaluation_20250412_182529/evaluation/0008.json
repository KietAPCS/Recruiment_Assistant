    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates proficiency in C/C++ and Python, essential languages for web development and autonomous systems. The CV highlights experience with relevant tools and frameworks like Visual Studio, Github, and Cmake. However, explicit mention of web development technologies like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL is limited, affecting the overall score. While the candidate has experience in embedded systems and machine learning, the CV could benefit from a clearer articulation of skills directly applicable to web development. Knowledge in backend web technologies is implicit in the projects she has done, but could be made explicit to further strengthen the CV.",

    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving and Debugging Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV provides examples of debugging and problem-solving within the context of embedded systems and software development (e.g., 'Debug, analyse reported problems'). The candidate showcases problem-solving skills through project descriptions, such as designing and implementing transformer architectures and addressing challenges in data augmentation and processing. However, specific instances demonstrating problem-solving in a web development context are limited. The experience with testing techniques (white-box, black-box) strengthens this category.",

      "category": "Collaboration and Communication Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate highlights teamwork and cooperation with other developers, which is a positive indicator of collaboration skills. The experience as a Research Assistant and Embedded System Software Developer involved cooperation and communication. However, the CV could provide more concrete examples of effectively communicating technical information to non-technical audiences. The soft skills listed ('Teamwork, Active Listening, Negotiation') suggest good communication abilities, but these should be supported with examples.",

    {
      "category": "Continuous Learning and Adaptability",
      "explanation": "The candidate's pursuit of multiple degrees (Master's in Autonomous Systems, MSc in Computer Science) and involvement in research projects demonstrates a commitment to continuous learning. The CV also shows adaptability through the use of various tools, frameworks, and platforms. The candidate's eagerness to explore machine learning applications further indicates a proactive approach to staying current with industry trends. The candidate also lists a number of courses that are relevant to continuous learning and adaptability.",
