      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "Hedy demonstrates a strong technical foundation with experience in several relevant languages (C, Java, JavaScript, Python, R, Scala, SQL) and technologies (Docker, Flask, Git, Node.js, PyTorch, React.js, REST APIs). The listed tools (Apache Beam/Hadoop/Spark, BigQuery, GCP, Jira, Jenkins, Jupyter, Snowflake, Tableau) further solidify her data engineering and development skills. However, the CV lacks specific details on the depth of knowledge in each area, which could be strengthened by quantifying achievements or detailing specific projects where these skills were applied. The listed skills align well with web development, especially considering the front-end (JavaScript, React.js) and back-end (Node.js, SQL) technologies mentioned.",
      "score": "8"
    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving and Debugging Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV showcases problem-solving skills through project descriptions and experience bullet points. For example, at Spotify, Hedy designed and implemented a dataset that reduced computational overhead. At Comtech, she automated the backend API test suite, which led to a reduction in error response time. The RoadRisk project demonstrates analytical skills in predicting accident severity. The CV could benefit from explicitly stating her approach to debugging or handling specific technical challenges to further highlight these skills.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Collaboration and Communication Skills",
      "explanation": "Hedy's experience as a Lead Teaching Assistant highlights her ability to manage and coordinate support tasks for a team. Her Apple internship demonstrates her ability to present findings and recommendations to senior VPs. The experience section also implies teamwork, though specific examples of collaborating with other developers are somewhat limited. Mentioning specific collaborative projects or instances where she effectively communicated technical information would strengthen this area.",

    },
    {
      "category": "Continuous Learning and Adaptability",
      "explanation": "The CV indicates a proactive approach to learning through the variety of technologies and tools listed. The projects also showcase a willingness to apply her skills in different domains (traffic incidents, wildfires). Mentioning specific training courses, certifications, or contributions to open-source projects would further demonstrate a commitment to continuous learning and adaptability.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "HTML/CSS Proficiency",
      "explanation": "While the CV mentions JavaScript, React.js and overall web development experience, there is no explicit mention of HTML/CSS. Given that HTML and CSS are fundamental skills for a web developer, the absence of explicit mention impacts the overall evaluation. Implicitly, the front-end work described under 'Comtech Telecommunications' likely involves HTML/CSS, but this should be explicitly stated.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "JavaScript Proficiency",
      "explanation": "Hedy lists Javascript and React.js under Technical Skills, and describes building and deploying front-end features at Comtech Telecommunications. This indicates some JavaScript proficiency. Adding specific examples of JavaScript-powered functionality in the projects or experience sections would provide further evidence of proficiency.",
      "score": "4"
    },
    {
      "category": "Backend Technologies (PHP, SQL) Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The CV lists SQL under Technical Skills, and mentions experience with BigQuery and GCS at Spotify, which implies database knowledge. While PHP is not explicitly mentioned, the presence of SQL experience and backend-related tasks suggests a basic understanding. Detailing specific projects or tasks involving database design or SQL queries would strengthen this area.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Version Control (Git) Proficiency",
      "explanation": "Git is listed under Technical Skills, which indicates familiarity with version control. However, the CV lacks specific examples of using Git in a collaborative environment, such as contributing to open-source projects or using branching strategies. Providing more details on her Git workflow would improve the assessment.",
