      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates a solid understanding of various technologies, including Java, Python, JavaScript, React, React Native, Node.js, Express.JS, SQL, HTML/CSS, and related frameworks. The projects listed showcase the practical application of these skills. The candidate lists relevant developer tools, indicating familiarity with the software development lifecycle. The depth of knowledge within each technology is difficult to ascertain without further assessment, but the breadth is impressive. The candidate needs to improve on listing the version number of the technology, to have a better understanding of the experience.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Problem Solving and Analytical Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV demonstrates problem-solving skills through the description of projects. Each project outlines a problem (e.g., automating guidance for a game, managing ads, creating a chat application, building a booking application) and describes the solution implemented by the candidate. The descriptions highlight the ability to analyze requirements and design solutions. The level of complexity and the candidate's individual contribution within team projects are not entirely clear from the CV alone.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Communication and Collaboration",
      "explanation": "The candidate's communication skills are demonstrated through the clear descriptions of projects and responsibilities. The description of leading the Technical Department indicates leadership and organizational skills, which implicitly involve communication and collaboration. However, there's no explicit mention of specific communication strategies or collaborative techniques used. Additional details regarding teamwork dynamics and communication effectiveness would strengthen this section. The projects highlight the candidate's ability to work in a team, but the specific role in each project could be clarified further to indicate individual contributions vs. collaborative efforts.",

    {
      "category": "Experience and Qualifications",
      "explanation": "The candidate is currently pursuing a Bachelor of Information Technology degree and is expected to graduate in Oct. 2025. The listed experience includes a role in the Technical Department at the university. The projects provide relevant experience, showcasing practical application of skills.

    {
      "category": "Code Quality and Testing",
      "explanation": "The CV doesn't provide direct evidence of code quality or testing practices. There's no mention of testing methodologies, code review processes, or specific testing frameworks used. While the projects suggest the candidate can write functional code, there's no indication of the code's maintainability, readability, or test coverage. Code samples or links to GitHub repositories would allow for a more thorough assessment of code quality and testing practices.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "System Design",
      "explanation": "The project descriptions touch on system design aspects, such as designing the front-end interface, developing RESTful APIs, and implementing admin features. However, the CV lacks detailed information about the system architecture, scalability considerations, or design choices made. More information about architectural patterns, database design, and system performance considerations would demonstrate a deeper understanding of system design principles.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Adaptability and Learning Agility",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates adaptability and learning agility by showcasing a variety of projects using different technologies. The rapid development of a mobile application within two weeks during the GDSC Solution Hackathon indicates the ability to quickly learn and apply new skills. However, the CV lacks specific examples of how the candidate has overcome challenges or adapted to changing project requirements. More concrete examples of learning new technologies and adapting to new environments would strengthen this section.",

    {
      "category": "Teamwork and Collaboration Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate's experience in the Thach thuc Technical Department, including roles as a member and Vice Chairman, suggests teamwork and collaboration skills. Leading the department implies the ability to coordinate and collaborate with team members. However, the CV lacks specific examples of collaborative efforts, communication strategies, or conflict resolution skills. Providing concrete examples of teamwork and collaboration would strengthen this section.",
      "score": "4"
    },
    {
      "category": "Customer Focus",
      "explanation": "The project descriptions indicate some level of customer focus, particularly in the Ads Management Website and Booking Application, where the candidate implemented features allowing citizens to create/edit ads and users to browse/book hotels. However, the CV lacks explicit mention of customer needs analysis, user feedback incorporation, or customer satisfaction metrics. Further details on how the candidate considered and addressed customer needs would demonstrate a stronger customer focus.",
