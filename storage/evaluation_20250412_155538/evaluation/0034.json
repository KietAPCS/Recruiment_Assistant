      "explanation": "Alan demonstrates a strong technical proficiency based on the skills and experience listed. The CV highlights experience with Python, Java, C++, SQL, and JavaScript, as well as relevant frameworks like React, Node.js, TensorFlow, and Pandas. They also possess experience with tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Git, AWS, and PostgreSQL. The descriptions of their projects at IBM and Fidelity demonstrate practical application of these skills.

      "category": "Problem Solving and Analytical Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV showcases problem-solving and analytical skills through the description of projects at IBM and Fidelity. For example, at IBM, they 'Analyzed hundreds of trending, book-based playlists and conducted A/B tests to validate targeted audiobook campaigns, uncovering avenues for audience growth.' At Fidelity, they 'Developed SQL queries to optimize financial data retrieval, reducing query execution time by 35%.' These examples demonstrate an ability to analyze data, identify problems, and implement effective solutions. Further elaboration on the complexity of the problems solved would strengthen this section.",

      "explanation": "The CV lacks specific details about communication and collaboration skills. While the job descriptions imply teamwork, there is no direct mention of how Alan effectively communicated with team members, stakeholders, or clients. Stating that he presented research at a workshop is good, but doesn't elaborate on how he works with others on projects.",

      "explanation": "Alan has a strong educational background with a Master of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Environmental Science. His industry experience includes roles at IBM and Fidelity Investments, and he has research experience at UNC-Chapel Hill. The descriptions of his roles demonstrate relevant experience. The CV indicates a graduation date of May 2027 for the Master's degree, which suggests this is a future graduation date. This suggests he's currently a student. The work experience seems to be 2 years at IBM, and a summer internship at Fidelity. The research assistant role overlaps with the IBM role, which could use clarification.",

      "category": "Code Quality and Testing",
      "explanation": "The CV does not explicitly address code quality or testing practices. The mention of 'Test-Driven Development' under 'Methodologies' suggests familiarity, but there are no concrete examples of how Alan ensures code quality or writes effective tests. The candidate should include some of their experiences with doing code reviews to raise the score.",

      "category": "System Design",
      "explanation": "The CV provides limited information about system design abilities. The IBM experience of 'Designed a cumulative aggregated dataset hosted in BigQuery and GCS' hints at system design, but lacks detail about the design process, considerations for scalability, reliability, or the architectural choices made. The job descriptions don't elaborate on his design decisions.",

      "category": "Adaptability and Learning Agility",
      "explanation": "The CV suggests adaptability and learning agility through the diverse range of technologies and skills listed. The fact that he is pursuing a Master's degree indicates a willingness to learn. However, there are no explicit examples of how Alan quickly learned a new technology or adapted to a changing project requirement. The range of projects and languages used suggest he is adaptable. Providing specific instances would improve this section.",
