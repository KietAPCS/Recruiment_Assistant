    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates proficiency in several languages (C++, C#, Java, Python) and frameworks (Unity, Qt5, Spring Boot, Django). Experience with developer tools like Git, MySQL, and PostgreSQL is a plus. The depth of knowledge in each area is not fully evident but the variety is promising. This demonstrates a solid foundation for a software engineer role.",
      "score": "8"
    },
    {
      "category": "Problem Solving and Analytical Skills",
      "explanation": "The projects listed, such as the Parser \u0026 Computer Algebra System and the Underwater Physic Engine, indicate good problem-solving abilities. Implementing algorithms like Verlet integration, L-System calculation, Perlin flowfield, Flocking, Intelligent Driver Model and DFS, BFS, Djikstra, Bridges and Articulation Points, Strongly Connected Components (Tarjanâ€™s algorithm) showcases analytical skills and the ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems. More details on the complexity and challenges overcome in these projects would further strengthen the assessment.",
      "score": "8"
    },
    {
      "category": "Communication and Collaboration",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions designing lesson plans and mentoring, which suggests good communication skills. The software development internship and project work likely involved collaboration. However, the CV doesn't explicitly highlight teamwork or collaboration skills. Providing specific examples of how the candidate contributed to a team would be beneficial.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Experience and Qualifications",
      "explanation": "The candidate is currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (expected graduation 2027), suggesting that they may be more junior. The internship experience at FPT Information System is relevant, especially the development of RESTful APIs and implementation of authentication systems. The Programming Mentor role also adds value. The certifications and awards further strengthen the profile. Overall the candidate is relatively junior, but has some solid experience.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Code Quality and Testing",
      "explanation": "The CV doesn't provide direct information about code quality or testing methodologies used. While the projects imply that the candidate can produce functional code, there's no mention of unit tests, integration tests, or code review processes. Including details about testing practices would significantly improve this aspect of the evaluation.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "System Design",
      "explanation": "The projects demonstrate an understanding of system design principles. For instance, the Parser \u0026 Computer Algebra System and Microscopic Traffic Simulator required designing systems to handle complex logic and data. However, the CV lacks explicit details about architectural decisions or considerations for scalability and reliability. Elaborating on the design choices made in these projects would be helpful.",
      "score": "4"
    },
    {
      "category": "Adaptability and Learning Agility",
      "explanation": "The variety of technologies and frameworks used in different projects (C++, C#, Java, Python, Unity, Qt5, Spring Boot, Django) suggests adaptability and a willingness to learn new skills. However, the CV doesn't explicitly state how the candidate learned these technologies or how quickly they adapted to new project requirements. Adding specific examples of learning new technologies and applying them effectively would strengthen this category.",
      "score": "4"
    },
    {
      "category": "Teamwork and Collaboration Skills",
      "explanation": "While the CV highlights experience in a Software Development Intern position, there are no specific examples of teamwork or collaborative accomplishments. More information on communication skills and ability to contribute positively to team development environments is needed.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Customer Focus",
      "explanation": "There is nothing in the provided CV to assess the candidate's focus on or understanding of customer needs. The candidate needs to explicitly state examples of how they worked with customers or translated needs into technical requirements.",
