    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate lists several technical skills including MATLAB, LabView, SolidWorks, and Fritzing. These are valuable in engineering roles, but their relevance to a software engineer position is limited. The CV doesn't showcase traditional software engineering skills such as programming languages (Java, Python, C++), software development frameworks, or experience with cloud platforms. The projects demonstrate engineering design skills rather than software development. The projects focus more on hardware and physical prototypes rather than software development and applications. Needs to provide more software related project to get a better score",

    },
    {
      "category": "Problem Solving and Analytical Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates problem-solving skills through project descriptions, outlining the design and prototyping of various devices. The descriptions show an ability to identify requirements, develop solutions, and test prototypes. However, the CV lacks examples of algorithmic problem-solving, data analysis, or software debugging, which are more directly relevant to software engineering. Adding more details about how they overcame technical challenges in their projects will improve the score.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Communication and Collaboration",
      "explanation": "The candidate's experience as a peer tutor demonstrates strong communication and collaboration skills. They assist students, design newsletters, organize events, and train new recruits. These activities require effective communication, teamwork, and the ability to explain complex concepts clearly. The candidate also delivered a presentation to the Biomedical Engineering Society, further indicating communication skills. It would be useful to get more details about teamwork and collaboration in their projects.",

    {
      "category": "Experience and Qualifications",
      "explanation": "The candidate has a Bachelor of Science degree in Biomedical Engineering and tutoring experience. This academic background provides a foundation for analytical and problem-solving skills. However, the candidate lacks direct professional experience in software engineering. The projects are relevant to engineering but are not directly related to software development. To improve this section, the candidate should include any personal coding projects, online courses, or hackathon experiences related to software engineering.",
      "score": "4"
    },
    {
      "category": "Code Quality and Testing",
      "explanation": "The CV does not provide information about the candidate's code quality or testing practices. There are no code samples or mentions of testing methodologies. This is a significant gap for a software engineer role. Providing links to GitHub or including code snippets would improve the evaluation.",
      "score": "1"
    },
    {
      "category": "System Design",
      "explanation": "The CV provides no specific evidence of system design skills. The projects involve designing physical devices rather than software systems. Therefore, there's not enough information to evaluate their ability to define requirements, choose appropriate technologies, and design system architectures.",
      "score": "1"

    {
      "category": "Adaptability and Learning Agility",
      "explanation": "The CV indicates a willingness to learn, as evidenced by the candidate's pursuit of a Biomedical Engineering degree and their involvement in tutoring. The candidate utilizes digital platforms for tutoring, which indicates adaptability. However, the CV lacks explicit examples of learning new technologies or adapting to changing project requirements in a software engineering context. Providing examples of quickly learning new software/frameworks to complete the project will improve the score.",
      "score": "3"

    {
      "category": "Teamwork and Collaboration Skills",
      "explanation": "The TRIO Scholars Program experience demonstrates a capacity for teamwork through assisting students, organizing social events, and training recruits. These activities show some capacity for effective communication and collaboration. Providing specifics on how they collaborated on specific design tasks would be beneficial.",

    {
      "category": "Customer Focus",
      "explanation": "The tutoring experience implicitly demonstrates some customer focus, as the candidate assists students with their academic needs. However, the CV doesn't explicitly highlight a focus on understanding and meeting customer needs in a software development context. Providing evidence of proactively gathering requirements or feedback to improve the device will significantly improve the score.",
