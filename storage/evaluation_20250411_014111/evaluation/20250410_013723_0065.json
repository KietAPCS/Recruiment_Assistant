    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates proficiency in several visualization, modeling, and fabrication tools. They have experience diagnosing digital fabrication equipment and assisting with projects. While the tools listed are relevant to architecture, the CV lacks specific details about software engineering skills. There is no mention of programming languages or software development methodologies. The score reflects the candidate's proficiency in related tools but a lack of direct software engineering skills.",
      "score": "4"
    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions diagnosing equipment and aiding with assessments, which suggests some problem-solving abilities. However, the descriptions are vague and do not provide concrete examples of complex problem-solving in a software engineering context. The candidate's experience as a Digital Fabrication Lab Technician includes diagnosing innovative equipment, which is a testament to their problem-solving capabilities. More specific examples of how the candidate approached and resolved technical challenges would strengthen this area.",
      "score": "5"
    },
    {
      "category": "Collaboration and Communication",
      "explanation": "The candidate's experience as an event staff member and representation intern suggests good communication and teamwork skills. They have experience organizing events, providing instructions, and assisting clients. The CV explicitly mentions being an 'outgoing and optimistic teamplayer.' However, there's no mention of collaborative software development environments (e.g., working with version control systems, code reviews).",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Adaptability and Learning Agility",
      "explanation": "The CV highlights the candidate's willingness to learn new knowledge and criticisms. Their diverse experience in different roles shows adaptability. The candidate's international student status and bilingualism also demonstrate adaptability. However, the CV lacks specific examples of rapidly learning new technologies or adapting to changing software development priorities. The 'Always ready to engage and absorb new knowledge' highlights their intent to learn.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Code Quality",
      "explanation": "There is no information related to code quality as no coding experience is explicitly mentioned in the CV. The candidate's skills mainly revolve around architectural software, visualization, and fabrication, not software development or coding practices.",
      "score": "1"
    },
    {
      "category": "Testing and Debugging",
      "explanation": "The CV does not mention any experience with software testing or debugging. Their experience is primarily in architecture-related tasks and digital fabrication equipment.",
      "score": "1"
    },
    {
      "category": "System Design",
      "explanation": "The candidate's experience seems focused on architecture, visualization, and fabrication, and lacks any mention of system design principles related to software engineering.",
      "score": "1"
    },
    {
      "category": "Knowledge of Relevant Technologies",
      "explanation": "The CV lists tools like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Rhinoceros, Revit, and AutoCAD, which are relevant to architecture but not directly applicable to most software engineering roles. There's no mention of languages like C#, .NET, SQL, or JavaScript.",
      "score": "1"
