      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates proficiency in several visualization and modeling software packages, including Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Lightroom, V-Ray, Enscape, Rhinoceros, Grasshopper, Revit, and AutoCAD. They also have experience with fabrication tools like laser cutting, ZUND digital cutting and routing, WAZER waterjet, 3D printing, and CNC milling. The candidate's experience as a Digital Fabrication Lab Technician and Representation Intern suggests a good understanding of the practical applications of these technologies. However, specific experience with software engineering technologies, languages, and tools is not mentioned, which is a weakness considering the software engineer role.",

      "category": "Problem-Solving Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV provides some evidence of problem-solving skills, particularly in the role of Digital Fabrication Lab Technician, where the candidate \"Diagnosed a variety of innovative equipment...to facilitate projects.\" The experiences as event staff and photography assistant showcase organizational and assistance capabilities, while internship tasks imply problem-solving in design and representation. However, the CV lacks concrete examples of complex problem-solving scenarios or independently developed solutions. More detail on specific problem-solving situations would enhance the evaluation.",

    {
      "category": "Collaboration and Communication",
      "explanation": "The candidate's experience as Event Services Staff and in various student organizations highlights collaboration and communication skills. Specific mentions of 'greeting guests, ticketing, information, and audio-visual' during events, 'aiding supervisors,' and 'participated in meetings with foreign clients as an assisting translator' all suggest good communication skills. Also, 'Outgoing and optimistic teamplayer creates strong bonds when working with other people, committing to an exceptional teamwork' shows self-awareness. However, quantifiable results of collaboration are not provided and there's no specific example of conflict resolution.",

      "category": "Adaptability and Learning Agility",
      "explanation": "The CV demonstrates adaptability through diverse experiences, from event services to digital fabrication and representation. The statement \"Always ready to engage and absorb new knowledge and criticisms\" explicitly states their openness to learning. The candidate's ability to assist with diverse equipment and software and function in different roles (technician, event staff, intern) indicates a degree of adaptability. However, there's no mention of adapting to rapidly changing software or technology-related environments. No professional development activities are listed.",

      "category": "Testing and Debugging",
      "explanation": "The resume does not provide enough information to evaluate testing and debugging skills. There are no projects or roles mentioned that involve software development or quality assurance. Thus, it is hard to assess their ability to write effective unit tests, debug code or identify and resolve software defects.",

      "category": "System Design",
      "explanation": "The resume lacks evidence to evaluate system design skills. The candidate's experience is primarily in architecture and design visualization, which doesn't directly translate to software system design. There is no information to determine if they can design scalable, reliable, and maintainable software systems.",
