    },
    {
      "category": "Code Quality",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions using TypeScript for better type handling in the EvoGym project, implying an awareness of code quality and maintainability. However, there are no specific details on coding standards followed, testing methodologies used, or examples of well-documented code. The descriptions of the projects are high-level and do not delve into the specifics of the code. Due to the lack of specific information, it's difficult to assess the code quality definitively. More details on coding practices and examples of code would be beneficial.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Testing and Debugging",
      "explanation": "The CV does not explicitly mention any experience with testing or debugging. While the candidate likely performed these tasks during project development, the lack of specific information makes it difficult to assess their skills in this area. Including examples of testing frameworks used, debugging techniques applied, or contributions to identifying and resolving software defects would significantly improve this section.",

    {
      "category": "Knowledge of Relevant Technologies",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates solid understanding and practical experience with Reactjs, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript, as evidenced by their project descriptions. The use of TypeScript suggests familiarity with modern JavaScript development practices. However, the CV does not mention any experience with backend technologies or databases. If the target role requires knowledge of C#, .NET, or SQL, this could be a potential weakness.",
      "score": "4"
    },
    {
      "category": "Agile Methodologies",
      "explanation": "The CV does not explicitly mention experience with Agile methodologies. While it's possible that the candidate used Agile practices in their projects, the lack of specific information makes it difficult to assess their knowledge and experience in this area.
