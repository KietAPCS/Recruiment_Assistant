      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates proficiency in several programming languages, including C++, Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript. They also have experience with relevant frameworks and tools like Reactjs, TailwindCSS, and Figma. The projects listed showcase practical application of these technologies. However, the depth of knowledge in each technology is not fully evident from the resume alone. It's unclear how experienced they are with backend technologies or databases. The expected graduation date is June 2027, meaning they are still a student. Therefore, the technical proficiency seems strong for their level, but a more in-depth assessment would be needed to determine if they are an expert in any of the technologies. It is missing knowledge about C# and .NET framework.",

    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV provides some evidence of problem-solving skills through project descriptions. For instance, the TikTok TechJam project mentions creating a solution to enhance Tailored Discovery. However, the resume doesn't explicitly detail the problem-solving process, challenges encountered, or the specific approaches used to overcome them. Further information is needed to fully assess their problem-solving abilities.",

    {
      "category": "Communication and Collaboration",
      "explanation": "The resume indicates some involvement in team-based projects such as the Health Recommendation System and the TikTok TechJam, implying the ability to collaborate with others. Additionally, their role as a Web Specialist in Google Developer Group suggests good communication skills. However, there is a lack of specific details on their contributions to team dynamics, conflict resolution strategies, or communication effectiveness within these roles. The Chess Club involvement suggests strategic thinking and communication, but more specific examples would strengthen this area.",

    {
      "category": "Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Knowledge",
      "explanation": "The project descriptions imply some familiarity with the SDLC, particularly in the context of front-end development. However, the resume does not explicitly outline their understanding or experience with different SDLC methodologies (e.g., Agile, Waterfall) or their involvement in phases such as requirements gathering, design, testing, or deployment. They seem to have practical experience from their projects but the resume lacks specific details to fully evaluate their SDLC knowledge. The mention of 'tech-sharing workshops' within Google Developer Group hints at SDLC exposure, but more clarity is needed.",
