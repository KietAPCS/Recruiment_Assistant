    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate lists several software and hardware skills, but the context is primarily within an architectural/design context. While they list Adobe products, Rhino, Revit, AutoCAD, and various fabrication tools, there is no direct mention of C#, .NET, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, or CSS. The candidate's technical proficiency in core software engineering technologies is not evident from the CV. This is a significant weakness for a software engineering role. There is evidence of digital skills, however, they do not align with typical Software Engineering requirements.",

    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions diagnosing equipment at the Pratt Interdisciplinary Technology Lab, which suggests some problem-solving ability. The role as a photography assistant also implies troubleshooting software and hardware issues. However, the CV lacks specific examples of complex technical problems solved and the approach taken. The descriptions are quite general, making it difficult to assess the depth of their problem-solving skills in a software engineering context. More specific examples would strengthen this area.",
      "score": "5"
    },
    {
      "category": "Communication and Collaboration",
      "explanation": "The candidate highlights being a 'teamplayer' and creating 'strong bonds' with others. Their experience as an event staff, treasurer, secretary, and representation intern suggests experience in coordinating with others and communicating information. The role of providing instructions to new staff and students further supports their communication skills. Overall, the CV demonstrates reasonable communication and collaboration abilities, though specific examples of navigating conflicts or complex team dynamics are missing.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Knowledge",
      "explanation": "There is no explicit mention of SDLC methodologies like Agile or Waterfall in the CV. The candidate's experience doesn't provide clear evidence of involvement in the different phases of software development. While they may have implicitly used aspects of SDLC in their roles, it is not demonstrated in the CV. This is a significant gap. More details about project workflows and methodologies would be beneficial.",
