      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "Terrence demonstrates a strong understanding of several technologies relevant to software engineering, including Python (with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Flask), SQL (Redshift, MySQL), and ElasticSearch. He has experience with recommendation engines, customer segmentation, and productionizing models. The CV highlights practical experience applying these technologies in previous roles, such as building a production recommendation engine in Python and using Python clustering methods to improve underwriting models. This aligns well with the requirements of a software engineer role, particularly one involving data science or backend development. Some evidence of web development technologies (HTML, CSS, Javascript) is missing, lowering the score slightly.",

    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving and Analytical Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV provides clear evidence of strong problem-solving and analytical skills. Terrence has a track record of analyzing complex problems, identifying root causes, and developing effective solutions. Examples include using A/B testing to solve client pain points, building customer attrition models, and identifying areas of improvement in underwriting models using Python. These examples demonstrate his ability to use data-driven approaches to solve business problems and improve key metrics. He is capable of independently analysing complex problems and proposes effective solutions.",

    {
      "category": "Communication and Collaboration Skills",
      "explanation": "Terrence's CV demonstrates good communication and collaboration skills. He has experience collaborating with cross-functional teams and communicating with PMs to lead data scientists in project planning, development, and execution. He also coached a data team throughout short and long-term projects. The CV does not explicitly state how well he communicates technical details to non-technical stakeholders, which impacts the score slightly. There is no mention of technical documentation creation.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Experience",
      "explanation": "The CV demonstrates experience with various phases of the SDLC, including development, testing (A/B testing), and implementation. The specific SDLC methodologies used (e.g., Agile, Waterfall) are not explicitly stated, making it difficult to fully assess his understanding of different methodologies. Mentions productionising models, suggesting experience with deployment. The level of involvement in requirements gathering or detailed design phases isn't clear.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Code Quality and Testing",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions A/B testing but lacks specific details about code quality practices, unit testing, or continuous integration. While building production recommendation engines implies some level of code quality, the absence of explicit statements about testing methodologies or code review processes affects the score.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Adaptability and Learning Agility",
      "explanation": "Terrence's experience in multiple data science roles at different companies (Best Buy, 2U) suggests a degree of adaptability. His use of various technologies and his ability to learn and apply new tools (e.g., Flask, ElasticSearch) point towards learning agility. However, concrete examples of rapidly adapting to completely new technologies or environments are not provided, which limits the assessment.",
      "score": "4"
    },
    {
      "category": "Customer Focus",
      "explanation": "The CV showcases some customer focus through A/B testing to solve client pain points and improving customer retention. The focus seems to be more on data analysis to improve business metrics, rather than direct customer interaction and support. There is no description about exceeding customer expectations.",
      "score": "3"

    {
      "category": "Teamwork and Collaboration",
      "explanation": "Terrence's experience leading data scientists in project planning and coaching data teams indicates strong teamwork and collaboration skills. He partnered with product teams to build recommendation engines. These examples demonstrate his ability to work effectively as part of a team and contribute to project success. The CV highlights his leadership role within the data team.",
