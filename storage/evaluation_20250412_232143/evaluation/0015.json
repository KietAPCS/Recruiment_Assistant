      "explanation": "Hedy demonstrates a strong foundation in various programming languages (C, Java, JavaScript, Python, R, Scala, SQL) and technologies (Docker, Flask, Git, Node.js, PyTorch, React.js, REST APIs). Her experience includes internships at reputable companies like Spotify, Apple, and Comtech, where she worked on data engineering and software engineering projects. She lists experience with tools such as Apache Beam/Hadoop/Spark, BigQuery, GCP, Jira, Jenkins, Jupyter, Snowflake, Tableau, showing a broad skill set. The roles suggest experience with data pipelines, dashboard creation, and feature development. Given her graduation date is May 2026, she is likely in her early 20s and her internship experiences are appropriate for her education level. The experience is well-described, but without verifiable links (e.g., to projects or contributions) a score of 8 seems appropriate.",

    },
    {
      "category": "Problem Solving and Analytical Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate's experience at Spotify, Apple, and in personal projects demonstrates strong problem-solving and analytical skills. For example, at Spotify, she designed a dataset to unify data pipelines and analyzed playlists to validate audiobook campaigns. At Apple, she streamlined data sources and presented findings for data infrastructure optimization. The RoadRisk and Flaming Insights projects further showcase her ability to analyze data, build models, and identify trends. These experiences demonstrate the ability to break down problems and come up with solutions.",

    {
      "category": "Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and Best Practices",
      "explanation": "The CV demonstrates exposure to the SDLC through various internships, especially the Software Engineer Intern role at Comtech where she built and deployed front-end features. Her use of Git suggests version control knowledge. The automation of the backend API test suite using Node.js and Chai indicates an understanding of testing practices. However, the CV lacks specific details on methodologies like Agile or Waterfall, and deeper insights into her approach to code reviews and documentation would strengthen this area.",

      "category": "Communication and Collaboration Skills",
      "explanation": "Hedy's role as a Lead Teaching Assistant demonstrates strong communication and collaboration skills. This includes hosting office hours, grading exams, and managing undergraduate teaching assistants. Her experience at Apple, where she presented findings and recommendations to senior VPs, also highlights her communication abilities. Her experience working in team settings during her internships suggests good collaboration skills, although specific examples of teamwork challenges and resolutions would be beneficial.",

    {
      "category": "Code Quality and Documentation",
      "explanation": "While the CV mentions various projects and technologies, it lacks specific examples of code samples or documentation. The description of automating the API test suite at Comtech hints at code quality awareness, but without concrete evidence, the score is limited to 3. Including links to GitHub repositories or mentioning contributions to open-source projects would significantly improve this score.",

    {
      "category": "Database Knowledge (SQL, ORM)",
      "explanation": "The candidate lists SQL under Technical Skills and mentions experience with BigQuery and Hive in her experience descriptions. Her role at Spotify involved designing a dataset hosted in BigQuery. This demonstrates practical experience with SQL and database technologies. However, the CV does not explicitly mention ORM experience.",
      "score": "4"

    {
      "category": "Web Application Frameworks",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions Flask and React.js under Technical Skills. Her experience building front-end features at Comtech and using React.js suggests familiarity with web application frameworks. However, the depth of her experience with these frameworks isn't clear from the CV alone.",

    {
      "category": "Test-Driven Development (TDD)",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions automating the backend API test suite using Node.js and Chai at Comtech, indicating some exposure to testing. However, there's no explicit mention of Test-Driven Development (TDD) or writing tests before implementing code.",
