    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate lists several software and design tools, including Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Lightroom, V-Ray, Enscape, Rhinoceros - Grasshopper, Revit, and Auto CAD. These tools are relevant to architecture and design but do not align directly with the typical technologies needed for a software engineering role (C#, .NET, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS). The candidate lacks demonstrable experience with software development principles. Therefore, the score reflects the limited overlap with required technical skills for a software engineer.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving and Analytical Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions diagnosing equipment issues and assisting with problem-solving in the Digital Fabrication Lab. The candidate describes helping students and teachers with software and photo-taking problems. These experiences suggest some level of analytical and problem-solving skills, but lack specific examples of tackling complex technical challenges within a software development context. The candidate shows potential but lacks demonstrable experience in solving software-related problems.",
      "score": "5"
    },
    {
      "category": "Communication and Collaboration Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate's CV highlights strong communication and collaboration skills through various experiences, such as event staffing, translation, and lab assistance. The candidate mentions conducting walkthroughs, giving instructions, assisting with lessons, and participating in meetings. These roles indicate the ability to communicate effectively with diverse stakeholders and collaborate within a team environment. However, there's no specific mention of communicating technical concepts clearly, which is crucial for software engineering.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Adaptability and Learning Agility",
      "explanation": "The candidate shows adaptability by taking on different roles, such as lab technician, event staff, and representation intern. The candidate is described as 'always ready to engage and absorb new knowledge and criticisms.' The variety of experiences, from architectural design to event organization, suggests a willingness to learn and adapt. However, there's no explicit mention of quickly learning new technologies or thriving under pressure in a software development setting.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Software Development Lifecycle Experience",
      "explanation": "The CV doesn't explicitly mention experience with the software development lifecycle (SDLC). The candidate's experiences are primarily in design, fabrication, and event organization, which don't directly relate to SDLC phases such as requirements gathering, design, development, testing, or deployment. The candidate lacks demonstrable experience in any stage of the SDLC.",
      "score": "2"
    },
    {
      "category": "Code Quality and Testing",
      "explanation": "The CV does not provide any information regarding code quality or testing experience. The roles described do not involve software development or testing, so there is no basis for evaluating this subcategory.",

      "category": "System Configuration and Maintenance",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions diagnosing equipment in a lab environment, which suggests some familiarity with troubleshooting. However, there's no explicit experience with system configuration and maintenance of software systems or servers. The experience is limited to physical equipment rather than software systems.",
      "score": "2"
    },
    {
      "category": "Domain Knowledge (Public Safety/Health)",
      "explanation": "The CV does not mention any experience in the public safety or public health domains. The candidate's experiences are primarily in architecture, design, and event organization, which are unrelated to these fields.",
