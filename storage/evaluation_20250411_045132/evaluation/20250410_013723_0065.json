    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates some technical skills, but they are primarily focused on design and visualization software (Adobe Suite, Rhino, Revit, AutoCAD). While these are valuable, the resume lacks explicit mention of C#, .NET, SQL, or other web technologies required for the software engineer role. There is some experience with digital fabrication, which indicates a potential aptitude for technical tasks. Given the absence of core software engineering technologies, the score is relatively low.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving and Analytical Skills",
      "explanation": "The resume provides limited evidence of problem-solving skills in a software engineering context. The descriptions of the roles mention diagnosing equipment and assisting with projects, which suggests some analytical abilities, but it does not clearly demonstrate the ability to analyze complex problems and develop effective solutions independently in a software development environment.",
      "score": "4"
    },
    {
      "category": "Communication and Collaboration Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate highlights strong communication and collaboration skills, citing experience as an event staff member, research assistant, and translator. These roles involve working with people, providing instructions, and facilitating communication. The resume explicitly mentions being an 'outgoing and optimistic teamplayer'. This aligns with the job description's emphasis on communication and teamwork.",
      "score": "8"
    },
    {
      "category": "Adaptability and Learning Agility",
      "explanation": "The candidate claims to be 'always ready to engage and absorb new knowledge and criticisms'. The diverse experiences, from event staffing to digital fabrication and translation, suggest some adaptability. However, without specific examples of quickly learning new technologies relevant to software engineering, the score is moderate.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Software Development Lifecycle Experience",
      "explanation": "The resume lacks any explicit mention of experience with the software development lifecycle. The roles described do not appear to involve participation in the different phases of SDLC (requirements gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance).",
      "score": "2"
    },
    {
      "category": "Code Quality and Testing",
      "explanation": "There's no information about code quality or testing. The candidate's experience does not seem to involve writing or testing code.",
      "score": "1"
    },
    {
      "category": "Database Skills",
      "explanation": "The resume doesn't mention any database skills or experience with SQL. Therefore, the candidate scores low in this subcategory.",
      "score": "1"
    },
    {
      "category": "Web Development Skills",
      "explanation": "The resume doesn't include any specific web development skills such as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, so the candidate's expertise in this area is unknown.",
      "score": "1"
    },
    {
      "category": "System Configuration and Maintenance",

    {
      "category": "Domain Knowledge (Public Safety/Health)",
