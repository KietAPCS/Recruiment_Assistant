(a)
First, let’s organize the data in ascending order:
418, 421, 421, 422, 425, 427, 431, 434, 437, 439, 446, 447, 448, 453, 454, 463, 465
Key statistics for the boxplot:
•
Sample size (n) = 17
•
Minimum = 418
•
First quartile (Q1) = 425 (5th value in the ordered list)
•
Median (Q2) = 434 (9th value)
•
Third quartile (Q3) = 448 (13th value)
•
Maximum = 465
•
−Q1 −425
Interquartile Range (IQR) = Q3 = 448 = 23
Degree of Polymerization
418 425 434 448 465
Interesting features:
•
The data appears slightly left-skewed (longer tail on the left side).
•
×
No outliers are present as all points fall within 1.5 IQR of the quartiles.
•
The median is closer to Q3 than to Q1, indicating skewness.
(b)
To assess whether the sample comes from a normal distribution:
•
Visual inspection: The boxplot shows slight left-skewness, which may deviate
from normality.

--- Page 4 ---
Lab Report Title 3
•
Normal probability plot: If constructed, the points should roughly follow a
straight line. Given the skewness, some deviation is expected.
•
Statistical tests: Shapiro-Wilk or Anderson-Darling tests could be used for formal
testing, but with n = 17, the power to detect non-normality is limited.
Conclusion: While the sample size is small, the slight skewness suggests some devi-
ation from normality. However, for many practical purposes, the distribution might be
considered approximately normal.

Lab Report Title 5
•
The prediction interval (17.256%, 32.744%) is much wider than the confidence in-
terval (23.062%, 26.938%).
•
This reflects the greater uncertainty when predicting a single observation compared
to estimating the population mean.
•
The prediction interval accounts for both the variability in estimating the mean
and the natural variability between individuals.

Given Data
•
Sample size (n) = 50 bulbs
•
Sample mean (¯x) = 738.44 hours
•
Sample standard deviation (s) = 38.20 hours
•
Standard error of the mean (SEM) = 5.40 hours
•
Test statistic (Z) = -2.14
•
p-value = 0.016
Hypothesis Test Setup
•
Null hypothesis (H0): µ = 750 hours
•
Alternative hypothesis (Ha): µ < 750 hours (one-tailed test)
•
Significance levels to consider: α = 0.05 and α = 0.01
Conclusions
1. For α = 0.05:
•
p-value (0.016) < 0.05
•
Reject H0
•
Conclude that there is sufficient evidence at the 5% significance level that the
true average lifetime is less than 750 hours
2. For α = 0.01:
•
p-value (0.016) > 0.01
•
Fail to reject H0

--- Page 9 ---
Lab Report Title 8
•
Conclude that there is not sufficient evidence at the 1% significance level to
claim that the true average lifetime is less than 750 hours
Recommended Significance Level and Conclusion
•
The choice of significance level depends on the consequences of Type I and Type II
errors:
– Type I error (false positive): Rejecting H0 when bulbs actually meet specifi-
cations
– Type II error (false negative): Failing to reject H0 when bulbs are inferior
•
For this consumer decision:
– A 5% significance level provides reasonable protection against accepting infe-
rior bulbs
– The 1% level might be too strict, potentially leading to accepting bulbs that
don’t meet specifications
•
Recommendation:
– Use α = 0.05 significance level
– Conclude that the bulbs have statistically significant shorter lifetime than
advertised
– Consider not proceeding with the purchase arrangement

Given Data
•
Sample size (n) = 30 pipes
•
Sample mean (¯x) = 206.73
•
Sample standard deviation (s) = 6.35
•
Standard error of the mean (SEM) = 1.16

Null hypothesis (H0): µ = 200 lb
•
̸=
Alternative hypothesis (Ha): µ 200 lb (two-tailed test)
•
Significance level: α = 0.05 (typical industrial standard)
Test Procedure Given the large sample size (n = 30) and approximately normal data
(from normal probability plot), we use a t-test:

Critical t-values:
•

•
Decision: Reject H0
p-value Approach
•
p-value < 0.0001 (for t = 5.807 with df = 29)
•
Since p-value < α (0.05)
•
Decision: Reject H0
Conclusion There is strong evidence (t29 = 5.807, p < 0.0001) to conclude that the true
average coating weight differs significantly from the production standard of 200.
The sample mean of 206.73 suggests that the process is applying more coating than
specified by the production standards.

Conclusion There is statistically significant evidence (t4 = p = 0.0208) to
conclude that the true average viscosity differs from the required 3000 Pa s.
The sample mean of 2887.6 Pa s suggests that the average viscosity is lower than the
required specification.
