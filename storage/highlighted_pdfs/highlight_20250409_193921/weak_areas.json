    "description": "This is a weak area because the job is for a Software Engineer. A Bachelor of Science in Business Analytics is not directly relevant to software engineering. The candidate needs to highlight how their analytics skills translate into software engineering skills or projects. They should emphasize any software development related coursework or projects undertaken within their degree."

For a Senior Software Engineer position, it's crucial to showcase proficiency in specific programming languages, frameworks, tools, and methodologies commonly used in the field. The list is too generic. The candidate should specify their expertise in languages like Java, C++, Python (with specific libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch), Javascript (with frameworks like React, Angular, Vue), cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), databases (SQL, NoSQL), and DevOps tools (Docker, Kubernetes)."

While these projects demonstrate analytical and problem-solving skills, they do not showcase the candidate's abilities in software development, design, or architecture. The candidate should include projects where they developed software applications, contributed to open-source projects, built APIs, or worked with specific technologies relevant to the senior software engineer role they are applying for."
