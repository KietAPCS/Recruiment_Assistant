While data science skills are valuable, the CV should be tailored to emphasize software engineering skills and experience. This should involve highlighting relevant projects, languages, and tools that align with the software engineering responsibilities. Change the title to 'Software Engineer' or 'Data Scientist with Software Engineering Experience' and rewrite the summary to reflect software engineering expertise."

It should be rewritten to emphasize software development experience, proficiency in relevant programming languages (Python, Java, C++ as per the job description), and experience with software development methodologies. The summary needs to convey that the candidate is looking for a Software Engineer role and possesses the necessary skills."

    "description": "While the experience at Lam Research is valuable, the descriptions are geared towards data science applications (AI-assisted computer vision, data pipeline development). These descriptions need to be reframed to highlight software engineering aspects such as code design, development practices, troubleshooting, debugging, and the technologies used from a software engineering perspective (e.g., specific libraries, frameworks, architectural patterns)."

Also, the job description mentions version control (Git). While implied, it's best to explicitly list 'Git' or 'Version Control (Git)'."
