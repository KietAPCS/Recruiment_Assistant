    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates some technical skills with software such as MATLAB, LabView, and SolidWorks, but these are more relevant to biomedical engineering than software engineering. There's a lack of core software engineering languages and tools like Java, Python, or relevant frameworks. The listed skills are at a basic level. Therefore, the technical proficiency for a software engineer role is low.",
      "score": "2"
    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving and Analytical Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate showcases problem-solving skills through the projects, especially in designing and testing medical devices. However, these examples are within the scope of biomedical engineering. The CV doesn't provide evidence of analytical skills related to software development challenges such as algorithm design or system optimization. Without specific examples related to software problems, the score is low.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Communication and Collaboration",
      "explanation": "The candidate shows communication and collaboration skills through the peer tutor role, including assisting students, designing newsletters, and organizing events. This suggests good interpersonal skills. However, the CV lacks examples of collaborating on software development projects or communicating technical concepts clearly in a software engineering context. The score is moderate.",
      "score": "5"
    },
    {
      "category": "Experience and Adaptability",
      "explanation": "The candidate has some experience as a peer tutor. The projects listed are relevant to biomedical engineering and do not showcase software engineering experience. Adaptability is implied by the willingness to tutor diverse subjects and use various digital platforms, but direct software engineering experience is missing. The overall experience in software engineering is limited.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Code Quality and Testing",
      "explanation": "The CV doesn't include any information related to code quality or testing practices in a software development context. There's no mention of unit testing, integration testing, or coding standards. Given the lack of evidence, the score is low.",
      "score": "1"
    },
    {
      "category": "System Design and Architecture",
      "explanation": "There is no information about system design or architecture in the CV. The projects described are focused on the design of medical devices and don't demonstrate understanding of software system design principles. Therefore, the score is very low.",
      "score": "1"
    },
    {
      "category": "Adaptability to New Technologies",
      "explanation": "The candidate's tutoring role and use of digital platforms indicate some adaptability to new technologies. However, there are no specific examples of learning and applying new software development technologies or frameworks. The examples provided (Canva, Zoom, etc.) are not complex development tools.",
      "score": "2"
    },
    {
      "category": "Teamwork and Collaboration",
      "explanation": "The peer tutor role demonstrates teamwork and collaboration skills, particularly in assisting students and organizing events. However, the CV doesn't provide any examples of collaborating on software development projects or working in a software engineering team. While the candidate shows collaborative abilities, their relevance to software engineering is limited.",
