      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "Khanh demonstrates proficiency in various languages and frameworks relevant to software engineering, including Java, Python, JavaScript, React, and Node.js. The projects showcase practical application of these skills. However, the depth of knowledge in each area is not fully clear from the CV alone. A stronger emphasis on specific technical accomplishments within each project could improve this section. The mentioned skills align well with the requirements of a software engineer role.",

    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving and Analytical Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV highlights problem-solving through project descriptions, specifically mentioning streamlining game operations and developing features for advertisement management and booking applications. The mention of reducing manual activity by 90% suggests strong problem-solving skills. The details provided in each project demonstrate analytical skills. However, the CV lacks specific examples of how Khanh approached and resolved complex technical challenges. Including such details would further strengthen this section.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Communication and Collaboration",
      "explanation": "Khanh's experience as Vice Chairman of the Technical Department in 'Thach thuc' suggests leadership and collaboration skills. The description of project responsibilities implies interaction with other team members and stakeholders. However, the CV does not explicitly detail communication strategies or collaborative efforts. Including specific examples of how Khanh effectively communicated technical information or resolved conflicts within a team would significantly improve this section.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Experience and Adaptability",
      "explanation": "The CV presents relevant experience through project descriptions and extracurricular activities. The variety of projects, including a game website, ads management platform, chat application, and booking application, demonstrates adaptability to different domains and technologies. The timeframe indicates that the candidate is still a student, and thus has limited professional experience, however the projects are a strong substitute. The CV could be enhanced by explicitly stating how Khanh learned and applied new technologies in each project.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Code Quality and Testing",
      "explanation": "The CV does not explicitly mention code quality or testing practices. While the projects suggest practical coding experience, there is no information about adherence to coding standards, use of comments, modular design, or testing methodologies. Including details about the candidate's approach to writing clean, maintainable code and implementing testing strategies would greatly improve this section.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "System Design and Architecture",
      "explanation": "The project descriptions provide some insight into system design and architecture, such as developing RESTful APIs and integrating the Mapbox API. However, the CV lacks details about the candidate's understanding of system design principles, architectural patterns, and considerations for scalability, performance, security, and maintainability. Including information about design choices and justifications would strengthen this section.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Adaptability to New Technologies",
      "explanation": "The CV demonstrates some adaptability to new technologies through the variety of projects and the use of different frameworks and tools. However, the CV lacks specific examples of how the candidate learned and applied new technologies in past projects. Mentioning attending conferences, online courses, or personal projects involving new technologies would improve this section.",

    {
      "category": "Teamwork and Collaboration",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions leading the Technical Department and contributing as a member, which suggests teamwork and collaboration skills. However, the CV lacks specific examples of collaborative efforts, conflict resolution, or the ability to provide and receive constructive criticism. Including details about how Khanh effectively communicated with team members, resolved conflicts, or contributed to team problem-solving would significantly improve this section.",
