    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates proficiency in multiple programming languages including Python, Java, C/C++, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Dart and Kotlin. They also list experience with technologies and frameworks like GitHub, Nodejs, Bootstrap, SpringBoot, MongoDB, Docker, and React Native. This indicates a solid understanding and practical experience suitable for a software engineering role. The projects listed further showcase the application of these skills in real-world scenarios. The candidate could benefit from elaborating on the specific versions or depth of knowledge for each technology to further strengthen the application.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving and Analytical Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate showcases problem-solving skills through the description of their projects. They outline the purpose of the applications, the roles they played, and the technologies used. Responsibilities are clearly defined for each project, highlighting contributions such as UI design, database design, API implementation, and architecture design. The description provided doesn't have in-depth explanations of specific technical challenges faced and how they were overcome.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Communication and Collaboration",
      "explanation": "The CV shows evidence of collaboration through project descriptions where the candidate worked as part of a team (e.g., Medical Booking Website). The roles within those teams are outlined. The descriptions are clear and concise, indicating a good ability to articulate ideas. The CV lacks specific examples of communication with non-technical stakeholders or instances of resolving conflicts within a team.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Software Development Lifecycle \u0026 Best Practices",
      "explanation": "The candidate's project descriptions hint at familiarity with the SDLC, including design, development, testing, and deployment. The use of GitHub for version control is explicitly mentioned. Specific testing methodologies or CI/CD practices are not detailed. Mentioning adherence to coding standards or providing code samples would strengthen this section.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Object-Oriented Design (OOD)",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions Java Application Programming which suggests familiarity with OOD principles. The project descriptions don't explicitly detail the application of OOD principles in system design. Providing examples of using inheritance, polymorphism, or encapsulation in their projects would improve this aspect.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Database Knowledge",
      "explanation": "The candidate lists SQL and experience with MongoDB and PostgreSQL. The Chat Application project specifically mentions database design using PostgreSQL. A deeper dive into database schema optimization or experience with ORM technologies (e.g., Spring Data JPA) could strengthen this section.",
      "score": "4"
    },
    {
      "category": "Web Technologies",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates experience with web technologies through the mention of HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React Native, and various web frameworks in their technical skills and projects. The Advertisement Management Website and Medical Booking Website projects showcase practical application of these technologies. The depth of experience with specific frameworks and web development best practices could be further elaborated.",
      "score": "4"
    },
    {
      "category": "Test Automation",
      "explanation": "The project descriptions mention 'testing' as a responsibility, but no specific test automation frameworks or methodologies are described. Providing details about experience with JUnit, Selenium, or other test automation tools would be beneficial.",
