    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates proficiency in several programming languages including C++, C#, Java, and Python. They also have experience with frameworks like Unity, Qt5, Spring Boot, and Django. The candidate also shows familiarity with developer tools such as Git, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Visual Studio, and Visual Studio Code. This aligns well with the job description's requirement for proficiency in languages like Java, C++, and Python, and experience in web-based environments and knowledge of databases. The variety of projects and experiences suggests a solid foundation. However, the depth of knowledge in each area is difficult to ascertain from the CV alone.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving and Analytical Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV showcases problem-solving skills through projects like the Parser \u0026 Computer Algebra System, Underwater Physic Engine, and Microscopic Traffic Simulator. Each project involved implementing complex algorithms and systems, indicating an ability to analyze problems and develop solutions. The mention of using 'Computer Algebra and Symbolic Computation' principles further highlights analytical abilities. The description of implementing traffic lights and intersections with dynamic car avoidance demonstrates practical problem-solving in a simulated environment. However, the resume does not explicitly state the approach, just the result, which makes evaluating in depth challenging.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Communication and Collaboration",
      "explanation": "The candidate's experience as a Programming Mentor demonstrates communication skills through designing lesson plans and explaining complex concepts to students. The mention of 'bilingual (English + Vietnamese)' lesson plans suggests adaptability and cross-cultural communication skills. While the CV provides no explicit examples of teamwork, the Software Development Intern role implies collaboration with other team members. More detail about collaborative projects and contributions to team environments would strengthen this area.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Software Development Lifecycle \u0026 Best Practices",
      "explanation": "The Software Development Intern experience at FPT Information System, specifically developing RESTful APIs using Spring MVC, suggests a familiarity with aspects of the software development lifecycle. The use of Git for version control and experience with databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL further supports this. However, the CV lacks explicit mention of testing methodologies, CI/CD practices, or adherence to specific coding standards. More details regarding their approach to testing, documentation, and deployment would improve this section.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Object-Oriented Design (OOD)",
      "explanation": "The use of languages like C++, Java, and C# implies a basic understanding of OOD principles. The projects, such as the Parser \u0026 Computer Algebra System, likely involve the application of OOD concepts. However, the CV does not explicitly detail the use of OOD principles or design patterns in their projects. Providing specific examples of how they applied OOD to solve problems would strengthen this section.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Database Knowledge",
      "explanation": "The candidate lists experience with MySQL and PostgreSQL, indicating knowledge of relational databases. The Software Development Intern role mentions working with datasets of up to 100k records, suggesting practical experience with database management. However, the CV doesn't specify their proficiency in SQL or their experience with ORM technologies. Adding details about SQL skills and ORM experience would be beneficial.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Web Technologies",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions experience with Spring Boot and Django frameworks, which are used for web application development. However, the CV lacks details about front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Describing experience with these technologies and web development best practices would significantly enhance this section, especially considering the Additional JD requirements.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Test Automation",
      "explanation": "The CV does not mention any experience with test automation frameworks or methodologies. The Additional JD specifically requires strong scripting and test automation abilities. The lack of information in this area is a significant weakness.",
