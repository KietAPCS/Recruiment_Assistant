      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates proficiency in several relevant languages and frameworks, including Java, Python, React, and Node.js. The projects showcase practical application of these skills. However, the depth of knowledge in each area isn't fully clear from the CV alone. The candidate lists SQL (Postgres) which aligns well with database requirements. The mentioned frameworks also fit web-based requirements. Overall, the candidate shows a solid foundation but could benefit from more specific examples quantifying the scale or complexity of projects.",

The descriptions quantify improvements (e.g., 'Significantly reduced manual activity by 90%'), which strengthens the claims. However, the CV could be improved by explicitly outlining the problem-solving process used in each project.",
