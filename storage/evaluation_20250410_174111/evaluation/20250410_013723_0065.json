      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates a range of technical skills, particularly in visualization, modeling, and fabrication. The skills listed are relevant to the architecture field and could be useful in a staff accountant role depending on the specific tasks (e.g., managing budgets for fabrication projects, reporting on software usage). However, the listed skills lack direct applicability to core accounting tasks such as financial reporting or reconciliation. While the candidate mentions proficiency in Microsoft Office, including Excel, the CV lacks explicit details regarding the use of these tools in a financial context. Therefore, while the technical skills are strong in their domain, their alignment with the specific requirements of a staff accountant is limited.  Score: 6/10",

    {
      "category": "Work Experience",
      "explanation": "The candidate's work experience includes roles such as Digital Fabrication Lab Technician, Event Services Staff, Representation Intern, and Photography Assistant. While these roles showcase diverse experiences, such as diagnosing equipment, organizing events, assisting with visualization materials, and guiding students, they do not directly align with the responsibilities of a staff accountant. There's a lack of experience in core accounting functions like preparing financial statements, managing budgets, or performing reconciliations. The experience as a Representation Intern provides some exposure to project-related tasks, but the CV does not quantify the impact or achievements in any of these roles. Therefore, the work experience is weak in terms of relevance to the staff accountant position. Score: 3/10",

    {
      "category": "Education",
      "explanation": "The candidate is pursuing a Bachelor of Architecture degree. While a strong academic background is valuable, an architecture degree is not directly related to the field of accounting. The education provides a foundation for analytical and problem-solving skills, but lacks the specific knowledge of accounting principles, financial reporting, and regulatory compliance that are essential for a staff accountant. Therefore, the education is general and not directly related to the job requirements. Score: 3/10",

      "category": "Leadership",
      "explanation": "The candidate held the position of Treasurer for NOMAS Pratt Chapter and Secretary for Vietnamese Students Association. These roles indicate some level of leadership and organizational skills. However, the scope and impact of these roles are not clearly defined. While serving as a treasurer implies some financial responsibility, the CV does not provide specific examples of financial management or decision-making. Therefore, the evidence of leadership is present but lacks details. Score: 3/5",

      "category": "Communication",
      "explanation": "The CV demonstrates some communication skills through roles such as Event Services Staff, where the candidate greeted guests and provided information, and Representation Intern, where they assisted as a translator. The candidate also conducted walkthroughs and gave instructions as a Digital Fabrication Lab Technician. These experiences indicate the ability to communicate effectively in different settings. However, there's no explicit mention of public speaking or formal writing. Overall, the communication skills are demonstrated indirectly. Score: 3/5",

      "explanation": "The candidate's role as a Digital Fabrication Lab Technician includes diagnosing issues with innovative equipment, which suggests problem-solving abilities. Additionally, guiding students through software issues and photo-taking processes as a Photography Assistant also demonstrates problem-solving skills. However, the CV lacks specific examples of overcoming significant challenges or implementing innovative solutions. Therefore, the signs of problem-solving are present but vague. Score: 3/5",
