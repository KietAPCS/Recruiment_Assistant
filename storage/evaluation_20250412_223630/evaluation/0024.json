      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates a strong understanding of relevant programming languages and web development technologies. The CV lists a wide range of languages (C, C++, C#, Java, Python, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, TypeScript, GraphQL, SQL) and technologies (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Management Server, Spring Boot, ASP.Net, NodeJS, ReactJS, NextJS, Django, Angular, SCSS/SASS, styled-components, Bootstrap, Redux, Express JS, Redis, ESLint, Git/GitHub, Postman, VS Code, Visual Studio, IntelliJ, PyCharm, Eclipse, Linux (Ubuntu 22.04), Docker). The work experience highlights practical application of these technologies in projects such as developing a CRM website and enhancing an AI recommendation system. The projects section further reinforces this with details of e-commerce and chatbot applications. The breadth and depth of knowledge suggest a high level of technical proficiency. The links to the candidate's GitHub are working and show actual projects.",

      "category": "Problem-Solving and Debugging Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV provides evidence of problem-solving and debugging skills through descriptions of work experience and projects. For example, the candidate mentions reducing response time for API calls, enhancing an AI recommendation system, and identifying key variables in data analysis. These actions suggest the ability to identify, analyze, and resolve technical challenges. Specific examples, such as the 30% reduction in response time due to the integration and extension of Django and ASP.NET APIs, and the 25% reduction in API call response time using Django REST/CRUD and Axios API calls, are strong indicators of problem-solving abilities. However, the CV could benefit from explicitly stating debugging activities.",
