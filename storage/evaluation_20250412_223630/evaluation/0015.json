      "category": "Problem-Solving and Debugging Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates problem-solving skills through their experience and projects. For example, at Spotify, they designed a dataset to unify multiple data pipelines, reducing computational overhead. At Apple, they streamlined data sources to reduce metric reporting time. At Comtech, they automated the backend API test suite, leading to a reduction in error response time. The RoadRisk project also showcases problem-solving by using machine learning models to predict accident severity. The CV highlights tangible results and quantifiable improvements, which is a strong indicator of problem-solving abilities. More details on debugging specific issues could be beneficial.",
