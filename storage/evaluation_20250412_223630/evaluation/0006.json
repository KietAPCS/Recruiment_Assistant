    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates good technical proficiency with a variety of languages (Python, Java, C/C++, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Dart, Kotlin) and technologies/frameworks (GitHub, Nodejs, Bootstrap, SpringBoot, MongoDB, Docker, React Native). The projects showcase practical application of these skills. The GPA and awards suggest a strong academic foundation. However, the depth of experience in each technology isn't fully clear from the CV alone. Further probing during an interview would be necessary to assess expertise levels. The mention of C/C++ is a plus, aligning with the Main JD requirements. JavaScript proficiency addresses both JDs. The range of technologies suggests a good understanding of web development principles.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving and Debugging Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV provides some evidence of problem-solving skills through the project descriptions. Each project outlines responsibilities and functionalities, implying problem-solving to some extent. The 'Advertisement Management Website' involved integrating a map API and managing different user roles, suggesting problem-solving in system design and implementation. Similarly, the 'Chat Application' involved designing a database and implementing API services. However, the CV lacks explicit examples of debugging or specific challenges overcome. More detailed STAR method examples in project descriptions would strengthen this area. Interview questions focusing on specific debugging scenarios would be beneficial.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Collaboration and Communication",
      "explanation": "The candidate has worked on team projects, as evidenced by the project descriptions and extracurricular activities ('GDSC Hackathon', 'Thach Thucâ€™s organization board'). The listed responsibilities ('Product owner', 'FE + BE developer', 'architecture designer') in the Medical Booking Website project suggest some leadership and communication. However, the CV doesn't explicitly detail communication strategies used within the teams or how they conveyed technical information. The project descriptions themselves are reasonably clear. References or more detailed descriptions of teamwork experiences would improve this category.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Web Development Specific Skills (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)",
      "explanation": "The candidate lists HTML/CSS and JavaScript under technical skills and utilizes them in multiple projects ('Advertisement Management Website', 'Medical Booking Website'). This demonstrates proficiency in core web development technologies. The 'Advertisement Management Website' project particularly highlights the use of JavaScript for implementing interactive features and handling user interactions. The description could be improved by mentioning the candidate's familiarity with responsive design or cross-browser compatibility considerations.",
      "score": "4"
    },
    {
      "category": "Experience with Web Frameworks and CMS (WordPress/Drupal/etc.)",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates experience with web frameworks such as Node.js, Express.js, SpringBoot and React Native. While CMS like WordPress or Drupal are not explicitly mentioned, the experience with frameworks suggests the ability to learn and adapt to different technologies. The use of SpringBoot in the Chat Application and Node.js/Express.js in the Advertisement Management Website and Medical Booking Website projects showcases practical experience. Mentioning any experience with customizing or extending frameworks would be a plus.",
      "score": "4"
    },
    {
      "category": "Understanding of Web Security Principles",
      "explanation": "The CV doesn't explicitly mention web security principles or specific security measures implemented in their projects. This is a significant omission, especially given the Additional JD's emphasis on security. While the candidate may implicitly consider security aspects during development, the lack of explicit mention weakens this category. Questions during the interview should focus on assessing their knowledge of common vulnerabilities and secure coding practices.",
