    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "An Bui demonstrates strong technical proficiency. The CV lists a wide array of languages and frameworks including Javascript, Python, Typescript, HTML, CSS, SQL, React.js, Next.js, Redux, Node.js, Express, Flask, and PostgreSQL. The projects showcase practical application of these skills. The experience at Arize AI highlights cloud resource management (AWS, GCP, Azure), Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform. The education section further supports the stated proficiency. Overall, the candidate seems well-versed in the required technologies. However, the level of proficiency (expert vs. strong) in each technology isn't fully clear from the CV alone.",
      "score": "8"
    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving and Debugging Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV demonstrates problem-solving and debugging skills through the technical experience section, particularly within the Arize AI role where the candidate 'streamlines codebase construction in response to customer-reported issues'. The project descriptions also hint at problem-solving, like 'designed a weighted search algorithm' in Eatsy. The level of detail could be improved to explicitly highlight debugging processes or specific problem-solving methodologies used. More concrete examples of complex problems solved would strengthen this section.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Collaboration and Communication",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions 'Collaborated with customers' at Arize AI and 'Client Collaboration' as a Freelance Fullstack Web Developer, indicating teamwork and communication skills. The projects also implicitly suggest collaboration if these were group efforts. However, the description of these experiences could be more specific about the nature of the collaboration and how the candidate communicated technical information to both technical and non-technical audiences. Quantifiable results of successful collaboration would further enhance the CV.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Web Development Specific Skills (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)",
      "explanation": "The CV explicitly lists HTML, CSS, and JavaScript under Technical Skills and within the App Academy certification. The project descriptions further showcase the use of these technologies in developing web applications. The listed projects such as OurBucks, Eatsy, and Anbnb all involve these core technologies. The use of frameworks like React and Next.js suggest a solid understanding beyond basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript. The candidate's profile aligns strongly with this subcategory.",
      "score": "5"
    },
    {
      "category": "Experience with Web Frameworks and CMS (WordPress/Drupal/etc.)",
      "explanation": "The CV demonstrates strong experience with web frameworks such as React.js, Next.js, Node.js, Express.js, Flask, and Redux. However, there is no mention of experience with CMS platforms like WordPress or Drupal. While the candidate clearly possesses skills in building web applications from scratch, the lack of CMS experience is a potential gap based on the job description. This is the area needs to improve.",
      "score": "4"
    },
    {
      "category": "Understanding of Web Security Principles",
      "explanation": "The CV does not explicitly mention web security principles or specific techniques for preventing common vulnerabilities like SQL injection or XSS. While the projects involve user authentication (Anbnb), the CV doesn't detail security measures implemented. This is an area where the candidate could strengthen their CV by showcasing their knowledge of secure coding practices and data validation techniques.",
