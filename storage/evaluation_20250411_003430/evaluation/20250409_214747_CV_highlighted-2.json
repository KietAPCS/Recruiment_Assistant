    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates good proficiency in several relevant technologies. Strong skills are evident in Java, Spring Boot, Next.js, and databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL. The projects showcase practical application of these technologies, including Spring Security for authentication and authorization, and Redis for caching. C#/ .NET and Microsoft SQL server are not explicitly mentioned, and while Javascript, HTML and CSS are used in Next.js, direct proficiency levels aren't detailed.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving and Analytical Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates good problem-solving skills through the projects described. The use of debounce for optimizing server load efficiency, i18n for dynamic content translation, JWT-based authentication, and Redis for caching indicate a solid approach to problem-solving. The candidate also includes awards for competitive programming which is a strong proof. However, specific examples of debugging complex issues or performance tuning in multi-server environments are not detailed.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Communication and Collaboration",
      "explanation": "The candidate has demonstrated communication and collaboration skills through group projects (FoodHub) and participation in WebDev Studio. The descriptions highlight involvement in development functions and workshops. However, the resume lacks specific examples of resolving conflicts or communicating technical information to non-technical audiences. References are not provided to verify these skills.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Knowledge",
      "explanation": "The projects described (OptiMart, FoodHub) suggest a good understanding of the SDLC, particularly in development, testing, and deployment phases. The use of Git and GitHub indicates experience with version control. However, the resume does not explicitly mention experience with different SDLC methodologies (e.g., Agile, Waterfall) or detailed involvement in planning, analysis, or maintenance phases.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Adaptability and Learning Agility",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates adaptability and learning agility through the adoption of new technologies like Next.js 14 and Material UI in personal and group projects. Participation in workshops and competitive programming also indicates a willingness to learn and adapt. However, the resume lacks specific examples of handling unexpected challenges or tight deadlines, or of continuous professional development beyond the listed activities.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Code Quality and Testing",
      "explanation": "The candidate provides Github repositories for the listed projects. The candidate used best practices to optimise the application. No information about code quality (clean code) or testing frameworks are discussed in the CV.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Database Knowledge",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates proficiency in database knowledge through the use of MySQL and PostgreSQL in their projects. The use of Spring Data JPA suggests experience with database interaction and management. The candidate did not state experience with database design, querying, and optimization. No information about experience with database security and performance tuning.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Web Technologies",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates solid web technologies experience, particularly with Next.js, ReactJS, Material UI, DaisyUI and TailwindCSS. Projects also indicate experience with RESTful APIs, but there is a lack of detail on aspects like web security or front-end performance optimization.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "System Configuration and Support",
      "explanation": "The candidate did not state any information about experience with system configuration, maintenance, and troubleshooting in multi-server environments. Therefore, the candidate needs significant guidance to troubleshoot system issues.",
      "score": "1"
    },
    {
      "category": "Agile Development",
      "explanation": "No direct mention of Agile methodologies is present, but the group projects suggest some level of familiarity with collaborative development practices. More explicit experience with sprints, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives would be beneficial to include.",
