      "explanation": "The candidate's resume showcases experience with digital fabrication equipment, visualization software (Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Lightroom, V-Ray, Enscape), and modeling software (Rhinoceros - Grasshopper, Revit, AutoCAD). While these skills are valuable in an architectural context, they don't directly align with the core technologies expected for a Software Engineer I role (C#, .NET, SQL, Javascript, HTML, CSS). The resume lacks any mention of programming languages or software development experience. Therefore the score is relatively low. There is no evidence about database knowledge or experience.",
