      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "Kim demonstrates a good grasp of frontend technologies such as Reactjs, JavaScript, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. The projects listed showcase practical application of these skills. The coursework in Computer Science, including Data Structures and Algorithms, provides a solid theoretical foundation. However, there is no mention of backend technologies or databases. The focus is heavily on the frontend, which might be a limitation depending on the role requirements. Further assessment of the depth of knowledge in each technology would be beneficial during an interview.",

    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV provides some evidence of problem-solving skills through project descriptions, such as enhancing tailored discovery for TikTok Shop and developing a health recommendation system. However, the descriptions are high-level and lack detail on the specific challenges faced and solutions implemented. The chess club involvement suggests analytical thinking, but the impact is not clearly quantified. More detailed examples during an interview or code review would provide a clearer picture of the candidate's problem-solving abilities.",

    {
      "category": "Communication \u0026 Collaboration",
      "explanation": "The CV demonstrates collaboration through project work and involvement in the Google Developer Group and the chess club. The description of responsibilities within these activities suggests the ability to work in a team. The role as a Tournament Organizer also indicates organizational and communication skills. However, specific examples of effectively communicating technical information or resolving conflicts within a team are missing. Behavioral interview questions could further assess these skills.",

      "category": "Experience \u0026 Education",
      "explanation": "Kim is currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a strong GPA. While the expected graduation date is in the future, the listed coursework is relevant. The project experience, although brief, showcases practical application of frontend development skills. The leadership and involvement activities demonstrate extracurricular engagement. However, the experience is relatively short, and further details about the projects and contributions would strengthen this section.",

    {
      "category": "Adaptability \u0026 Learning Agility",
      "explanation": "The candidate shows adaptability through involvement in various projects and extracurricular activities. The use of different frameworks and tools (React, TailwindCSS, Figma) suggests a willingness to learn new technologies. However, the CV lacks specific examples of adapting to changing project requirements or quickly learning a new technology to solve a problem. Behavioral interview questions focusing on these areas could provide further insights.",
