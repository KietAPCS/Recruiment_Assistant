    {
      "category": "Technical Skills \u0026 Experience",
      "explanation": "The candidate has some relevant technical experience, particularly with digital fabrication equipment and software like Rhinoceros and AutoCAD. However, the CV lacks explicit mention of core software engineering skills like C#, .NET, or specific database technologies. The experience as a Digital Fabrication Lab Technician is relevant, but its direct application to software engineering is limited. The internship at TTT Corporation provides some experience with producing visualization materials, but again, it's not directly software engineering related. The resume needs more details on software-specific projects or experiences.",
      "score": "4"
    },
    {
      "category": "Problem Solving \u0026 Analytical Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV demonstrates some problem-solving skills through the description of diagnosing equipment issues and aiding with assessments in the Digital Fabrication Lab. The role as a Photography Assistant also implies some problem-solving, particularly in guiding students through software issues. However, the examples are not explicitly software engineering-related, and the depth of analytical skills is difficult to gauge from the provided descriptions. More specific examples of problem-solving in a software context are needed.",
      "score": "5"
    },
    {
      "category": "Communication \u0026 Collaboration Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate highlights strong communication and collaboration skills, citing experience as an event staff, treasurer of NOMAS Pratt Chapter, and secretary of the Vietnamese Students Association. These roles suggest the ability to organize events, manage resources, and communicate with diverse groups. The role as a Representation Intern also indicates experience in participating in meetings and translating for clients. Overall, the CV provides solid evidence of communication and collaboration skills, though more details on technical communication would be beneficial.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Adaptability \u0026 Learning Agility",
      "explanation": "The candidate emphasizes a readiness to engage with new knowledge and criticisms, suggesting a willingness to learn and adapt. The diverse range of experiences, from architecture to event services and photography, also demonstrates adaptability. However, the CV lacks specific examples of quickly learning new technologies or adapting to rapidly changing project requirements. More concrete examples of learning agility in a technical context would strengthen this section.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "C# and .NET Proficiency",
      "explanation": "There is no mention of C# or .NET experience in the CV. Therefore, the candidate's proficiency in these technologies cannot be assessed based on the information provided.",
      "score": "1"

    {
      "category": "Database Technologies (SQL Server)",
      "explanation": "The CV does not mention any experience with SQL Server or other database technologies.",

    {
      "category": "Web Technologies (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)",
      "explanation": "The CV does not explicitly mention JavaScript, HTML, or CSS. While the candidate lists Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, these are not web technologies. Without further information, it's impossible to assess their familiarity with web development.",
      "score": "1"
    },
    {
      "category": "Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)",
      "explanation": "The CV lacks any direct reference to SDLC or experience with different phases of software development. Therefore, it's difficult to evaluate the candidate's understanding of SDLC.",

    },
    {
      "category": "Troubleshooting Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions diagnosing equipment issues as a Digital Fabrication Lab Technician, which indicates some troubleshooting ability. Additionally, assisting students with software issues as a Photography Assistant implies some troubleshooting skills. However, the CV lacks details on the complexity of the issues resolved and the troubleshooting methodologies used. The examples aren't clearly related to the context of software engineering. More software-specific examples are needed.",
