PROJECTS
Heart Rate Monitor
●
Designed a fingertip heart rate monitor using a photodetector and an Arduino Kit to trace the pulse on the finger.
●
Developed a LabView program to analyze the feedback wavelength from the infrared LED on the finger.
●
Performed prototype testing and evaluation to verify that the product achieves the criteria with up to 90%
accuracy.
External Fixator
●
Designed parts of an external fixator for children between 7-12 years old using SolidWorks.
●
Assembled all components to create the prototype using a 3D printer.
●
Simulated and analyzed stress and force from the arm on the fixator to find materials that best meet the criteria.
Hearing Aid
●
Designed the schematic drawing of the device using Fritzing and built a cost-effective prototype.
●
Delivered an effective presentation of the project to the Biomedical Engineering Society at UC Irvine.
Cerebral Palsy Headrest
●
Propose an engineering drawing design for a customized headrest support that meets the needs of the customer.
●
Conduct stimulation fatigue testing on the prototype and select appropriate materials to assure the durability of the
device.
●
Generate a quality test for the prototype that includes methods for executing load to failure and impact tests.
●
Assemble the initial prototype using affordable off-the-shelf components.
