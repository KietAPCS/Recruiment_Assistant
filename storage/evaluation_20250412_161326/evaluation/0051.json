    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates strong proficiency in multiple required languages and tools. They list C++, C#, Java, and Python under languages, and Unity, Qt5, Spring Boot, and Django under frameworks. They also list several developer tools and a library (SFML). The candidate showcases the use of these technologies in their experience and projects, indicating a solid understanding and ability to apply them. This aligns well with the job requirements.",
      "score": "8"
    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving and Debugging Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate's projects demonstrate problem-solving skills by implementing algorithms, simulating systems, and developing APIs. The descriptions highlight the complexity and scale of the problems tackled, such as parsing 10k characters, simulating constrained systems with 20k constraints/springs, and handling datasets of 100k records. These examples show the ability to analyze, design, and implement solutions for challenging problems. However, the CV doesn't explicitly mention debugging tools or techniques used, but the successful completion of these projects implies effective debugging.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Collaboration and Communication",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates communication skills through their experience as a Programming Mentor, where they designed lesson plans for students. The CV also shows clear descriptions of projects. There are fewer details on direct collaboration with other programmers or technical directors. Highlighting collaborative aspects of projects or mentioning experience with collaborative tools would strengthen this area.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Code Quality and Documentation",
      "explanation": "The CV doesn't explicitly mention code quality practices or documentation efforts. While the project descriptions suggest well-organized code, there's no direct evidence of adherence to coding standards or experience with code review processes. Providing links to GitHub repositories would allow for a direct assessment of code quality and documentation.",
      "score": "5"
    },
    {
      "category": "Adaptability and Learning",
      "explanation": "The candidate's project list and technical skills demonstrate a willingness to learn and apply new technologies. They have experience with a diverse set of languages, frameworks, and tools, indicating adaptability and a desire to expand their skill set. The projects showcase the application of learned concepts in real-world scenarios.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Attention to Detail",
      "explanation": "The candidate mentions specific technologies and details in project descriptions. The resume is well-formatted and appears to be carefully constructed.",
      "score": "4"
    },
    {
      "category": "Independence",
      "explanation": "The candidate's projects indicate an ability to work independently and take initiative. However, the CV doesn't provide explicit examples of managing time effectively or solving problems without supervision. The description of self-operated online mentoring suggests some level of self-direction.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Unity/Unreal Engine Experience",
      "explanation": "The candidate lists Unity under frameworks and has a project called 'Graph Drawer' in Unity. This demonstrates some experience with Unity, though the depth of experience is unclear from the description alone.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Web Development Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate lists Spring Boot and Django, indicating some web development skills. The experience section also mentions developing RESTful APIs. However, there is no mention of front-end web development skills such as HTML/CSS or JavaScript.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Quality Assurance Knowledge",
      "explanation": "The CV does not explicitly mention quality assurance processes or debugging techniques. While project completion implies some level of QA, there is no mention of TDD, code review, or specific debugging tools. Adding details about QA practices would be beneficial.",
