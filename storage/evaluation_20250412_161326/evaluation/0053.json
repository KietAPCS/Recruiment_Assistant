    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate's resume indicates proficiency in MATLAB, LabView, and SolidWorks, but it does not mention C#, C++, Objective-C, or JavaScript, which are listed as required programming languages. Therefore, the resume only partially aligns with the technical skills required for the job. The projects listed appear to be more focused on biomedical engineering, with limited software engineering elements. The score reflects the limited overlap with the requested software engineering skillset.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving and Debugging Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate's projects demonstrate problem-solving skills in a biomedical engineering context. However, the resume lacks explicit evidence of debugging skills in a software development environment. The project descriptions highlight design and prototype testing, but do not extensively discuss debugging of software code or complex systems. Thus, while problem-solving is evident, debugging skills are not strongly demonstrated.",
      "score": "4"
    },
    {
      "category": "Collaboration and Communication",
      "explanation": "The candidate's work experience as a Peer Tutor shows strong communication and collaboration skills. The description mentions assisting students, designing newsletters, organizing events, and training new recruits, which all involve effective communication and teamwork. However, the resume does not provide specific examples of collaboration within a software development team or contributions to technical design documentation. The score reflects good general communication skills but less direct alignment with the software engineering collaboration requirements.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Code Quality and Documentation",
      "explanation": "The resume mentions several projects, but it does not provide details on the code quality or documentation practices used. There's no information about version control systems, code review processes, or adherence to coding standards. The projects are primarily hardware-focused, with limited software development, and the documentation mentioned is more about project reports than code documentation. Hence, this area is not well-addressed.",
      "score": "2"
    },
    {
      "category": "Adaptability and Learning",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates adaptability by applying their skills in tutoring and by using various digital platforms. The resume shows a willingness to learn new tools and techniques. However, there's no specific mention of adapting to new software technologies or development methodologies. The candidate's education and experiences mostly center around biomedical engineering, and it is not clear how easily they can transition to a software engineering role. The score reflects general adaptability but less specific evidence of software-related learning.",
      "score": "5"
    },
    {
      "category": "Attention to Detail",
      "explanation": "The project descriptions indicate attention to detail through prototype testing and design verification. The tutoring experience also suggests a need for precision in explaining concepts. However, without specific examples of detail-oriented tasks in software development or quality assurance, it's difficult to assess the candidate's ability in this area within a software engineering context. The score is moderate, based on indirect evidence.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Independence",
      "explanation": "The resume highlights the candidate's ability to work independently as a Peer Tutor, assisting students and managing tasks. This suggests the capability to work without constant supervision. However, there are no examples of independent work within a software engineering project, which limits the assessment of this skill in the target domain. The score is moderate, based on general independence rather than software-specific examples.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Unity/Unreal Engine Experience",
      "explanation": "The resume does not mention any experience with Unity or Unreal Engine. Therefore, the candidate does not meet this beneficial skill requirement.",
      "score": "1"
    },
    {
      "category": "Web Development Skills",
      "explanation": "The resume does not list HTML/CSS or JavaScript skills directly. While the candidate uses digital platforms, this does not imply proficiency in web development. Therefore, the candidate does not demonstrate the beneficial web development skills.",
      "score": "1"
    },
    {
      "category": "Quality Assurance Knowledge",
      "explanation": "The resume does not explicitly mention quality assurance processes or debugging techniques in a software context. Although testing is mentioned in project descriptions, it is primarily in the context of hardware prototypes rather than software. The resume lacks details about familiarity with TDD, code review processes, or software debugging tools, which limits the assessment of this skill.",
