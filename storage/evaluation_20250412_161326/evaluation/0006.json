    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates proficiency in a variety of programming languages including Python, Java, C/C++, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Dart, and Kotlin. They also list experience with technologies and frameworks such as GitHub, Nodejs, Bootstrap, SpringBoot, MongoDB, Docker, and React Native. This suggests a strong foundation in software development, although the depth of knowledge in each area is difficult to determine without further assessment. The projects listed provide some evidence of applying these skills, but more detail on their specific contributions and the complexity of the tasks would be beneficial.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving and Debugging Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV provides limited direct evidence of problem-solving and debugging skills. The project descriptions mention implementing features and responsibilities, but do not explicitly detail challenges faced or debugging processes. During an interview, the candidate should be asked to provide specific examples to showcase these skills. The mention of testing in one of the project responsibilities is a good start but needs further elaboration.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Collaboration and Communication",
      "explanation": "The candidate lists responsibilities such as 'Product owner' and 'Designing UI using Figma' which implies some degree of collaboration and communication. Additionally, working in teams for projects such as the Medical Booking Website suggests experience in team environments. However, the CV lacks specific examples of how the candidate effectively communicated technical concepts or resolved conflicts within a team. More detail on their role in team projects and their interactions with other members would be beneficial.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Code Quality and Documentation",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions using GitHub for project repositories, which is a positive indicator of version control and collaboration. However, the CV does not explicitly state anything about writing clean, well-documented code or adhering to coding standards. Accessing the Github repositories would be needed to assess the code quality and documentation. It's a weak point in the CV.",
      "score": "5"
    },
    {
      "category": "Adaptability and Learning",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates a willingness to learn by listing a diverse range of technologies and frameworks. Their involvement in extracurricular activities like the GDSC Hackathon also shows initiative and a desire to expand their skills. The projects listed show a progression of skills and technologies used, but the CV could benefit from explicitly mentioning instances where the candidate learned a new technology to solve a specific problem.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Attention to Detail",
      "explanation": "The CV itself is well-formatted and contains no obvious errors, which indicates some attention to detail. However, there is no specific mention of attention to detail in the description of their responsibilities, or of the tasks carried out to the highest standard. Therefore, this quality is difficult to judge from the information provided.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Independence",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions roles such as 'Product owner' which suggest an ability to work independently and take initiative. However, the CV doesn't explicitly state the candidate's ability to work independently or their self-direction. More concrete examples of independent work and problem-solving would strengthen this aspect.",
      "score": "3"
    },
    {
      "category": "Unity/Unreal Engine Experience",
      "explanation": "The CV does not mention any experience with Unity or Unreal Engine. Therefore, the candidate receives the lowest score in this category.",
      "score": "1"
    },
    {
      "category": "Web Development Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV lists proficiency in HTML/CSS and JavaScript, and the projects include web development experience using Node.js, Express.js, and React Native. This suggests solid web development skills. The 'Advertisement Management Website' and 'Medical Booking Website' projects clearly demonstrate the application of these skills.",
      "score": "4"
    },
    {
      "category": "Quality Assurance Knowledge",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions testing as part of the responsibilities in the 'Advertisement Management Website' project. However, it provides no further details about the candidate's knowledge of quality assurance processes, debugging techniques, or code review processes. More information is needed to properly evaluate this aspect.",
