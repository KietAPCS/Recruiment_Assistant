    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates proficiency in technical skills such as MATLAB, LabView, and SolidWorks, but these are more related to biomedical engineering than web development. The candidate lists experience with software like Microsoft Office and Canva which are helpful but not primary web-dev skills. There's no explicit mention of web development languages, frameworks, or tools. This significantly limits the score in this category. The CV needs to showcase web-dev specific skills to improve this score.",
      "score": "2"
    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate's project descriptions highlight problem-solving skills within a biomedical engineering context. The descriptions involve design, prototyping, testing, and analysis. While these are valuable skills, their direct applicability to web development problem-solving isn't clear without more context. For example, detailing debugging processes or algorithm optimization would be more relevant.",
      "score": "5"
    },
    {
      "category": "Communication and Collaboration",
      "explanation": "The candidate's experience as a peer tutor demonstrates strong communication and collaboration skills. They assist students, design newsletters, organize events, and train new recruits. This shows an ability to communicate effectively with diverse audiences and work collaboratively. The presentation experience further strengthens this point.",
      "score": "8"
    },
    {
      "category": "Adaptability and Learning Agility",
      "explanation": "The candidate's academic background in biomedical engineering, coupled with their tutoring experience and project work, suggests a willingness to learn and adapt. The ability to transition between different technical subjects and software indicates some level of adaptability. However, there's no explicit mention of learning new web development technologies or adapting to changing project requirements within a web development context. Demonstrating this with relevant projects or coursework would significantly improve this score.",
      "score": "6"
