    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate lists a good range of programming languages including Java, Python, C, C++, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Assembly, and Swift. They also mention frameworks like React.js, Node.js, and Material-UI, along with developer tools such as Git, GitHub, VS Code, Visual Studio, IntelliJ, Vim, UNIX, and Bash. Their projects, like the Simple C Compiler and Marketplace Demo, suggest practical application of these skills. However, the depth of experience in C# and .NET, which are core to the job description, is unclear. While they have a solid foundation, further exploration is needed to determine their proficiency in the specific technologies required for this role.",

      "category": "Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Knowledge",
      "explanation": "The projects listed show involvement in various phases of the SDLC, from design and development to implementation. The Simple C Compiler project, for example, demonstrates understanding of compiler design principles and assembly code generation. There is a lack of information about understanding of Agile and Waterfall, or experience with CI/CD pipelines. Therefore, the knowledge of SDLC is not fully clear. ",
