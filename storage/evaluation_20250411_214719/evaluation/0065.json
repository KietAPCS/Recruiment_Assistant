    {
      "category": "Technical Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates some technical skills, mainly in visualization, modeling, and fabrication, relevant to architecture. However, there is no evidence of software engineering skills like C#, .NET, SQL, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Web Services, or ADO.NET. The listed skills are more relevant to CAD and digital design rather than software engineering. Therefore, the candidate's technical proficiency related to software engineering is low. The CV highlights experience with tools like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Rhinoceros, Revit, AutoCAD, Laser Cutting, 3D Printing and Scanning which are not directly applicable to software engineering positions. This CV is for an internship, not a full time position, so the skills shown here could potentially translate to the software engineering position if they learn the languages and technologies.",

    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving and Analytical Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions diagnosing equipment issues and aiding professionals with assessments, which suggests some problem-solving skills. However, it lacks specific examples of complex problem-solving in a software development context. The role as a lab technician and representation intern imply analytical skills, but these are not explicitly demonstrated as related to software.",

      "category": "Communication and Collaboration",
      "explanation": "The candidate highlights being a team player and creating strong bonds, which indicates good interpersonal skills. Their experience as an event staff, treasurer, secretary, and photography assistant also suggests good communication and organizational skills. Participating in meetings with foreign clients as an assisting translator also enhances these skills. However, the CV does not provide examples of communicating technical information to different audiences.",

      "category": "Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Knowledge",
      "explanation": "The CV provides no direct evidence of SDLC knowledge. The listed experiences do not relate directly to software development or the different phases of SDLC. The candidate may have been exposed to SDLC concepts in their coursework, but this is not evident from the resume.",

      "category": "Adaptability and Learning Agility",
      "explanation": "The candidate highlights their willingness to engage and absorb new knowledge, indicating a potential for adaptability and learning agility. The diversity of roles, from event staff to lab technician, also suggests adaptability. The role of digital fabrication lab technician, working with cutting-edge technologies demonstrates a propensity to learn and adapt to new technology.",
