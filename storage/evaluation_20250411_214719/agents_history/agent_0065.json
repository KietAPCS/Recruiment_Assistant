    "Response": "Based on the CV analysis, the candidate is **not currently well-suited** for a software engineering (SWE) role without further training and development in relevant areas.\n\n**Explanation:** The CV lacks specific software engineering skills (e.g., C#, .NET, SQL, Javascript, SDLC knowledge) and relevant experience. While the candidate demonstrates some transferable skills like problem-solving, communication, and adaptability, these are not sufficient for a SWE role without core technical expertise.\n",
