      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates a good range of technical skills, including proficiency in Python, Java, C/C++, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Dart, and Kotlin. They also list experience with technologies/frameworks like GitHub, Nodejs, Bootstrap, SpringBoot, MongoDB, Docker, and React Native. The projects showcase practical application of these skills, particularly in web development and database management. The projects provide context and demonstrate practical application of skills. However, the CV lacks detail on the depth of experience with each technology. More specific examples of how these skills were applied in the projects would strengthen the evaluation. Overall, the candidate appears to have a strong foundation in software engineering, but further clarification on their expertise level in each skill is needed.",

      "explanation": "The projects listed demonstrate problem-solving skills. For example, the Advertisement Management Website involved designing and implementing a system to manage advertising placements for different user roles. The Chat Application involved designing a database and implementing chat functionality using Java Swing and Spring Boot. The Medical Booking Website involved developing a web application for scheduling appointments and managing medical bookings. These project descriptions suggest that the candidate can analyze problems, identify key issues, and propose solutions. The responsibilities listed ('Designing UI using Figma, front-end and back-end side implementing, testing', 'Designing database, implementing chat UI, implementing API services', 'Product owner, FE + BE developer, architecture designer') suggests the candidate engages in problem-solving and analytical tasks, even though the CV doesn't explicitly state it. The candidate should include more details on the specific challenges they faced and the solutions they implemented.",
