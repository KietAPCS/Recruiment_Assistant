      "explanation": "Khanh demonstrates a good range of technical skills, including Java, Python, SQL, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. The listed frameworks (React, React Native, Node.js, Express.JS) and developer tools (Git, VS Code, Postman) are relevant and commonly used. The project descriptions provide evidence of practical application of these skills, particularly in web and mobile application development. There is a mix of front-end and back-end experience. However, the depth of experience in each technology is difficult to assess based solely on the CV. The experience at Thach thuc's Technical Department is a good start, but further detail on specific contributions and challenges overcome would strengthen the evaluation.",

    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving and Analytical Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV showcases problem-solving skills through project descriptions. For example, the Ads Management Website and Chat Application projects highlight the ability to design and implement complex features. The statement about reducing manual activity by 90% in the Thach Thuc project demonstrates analytical thinking and impact. However, the CV doesn't explicitly detail the problem-solving process or the alternatives considered. Including specific examples of how Khanh approached and resolved technical challenges would improve this section.",

    {
      "category": "Communication and Collaboration Skills",
      "explanation": "The CV provides some evidence of communication and collaboration skills through the experience in the Technical Department and as a lead in GDSC Solution Hackathon 2024. Leading the Technical Department as a Vice chairman indicates leadership and organizational skills. However, the descriptions are brief and lack specific details about communication strategies or conflict resolution. More information on team contributions, communication with stakeholders, and the ability to articulate technical concepts would be beneficial.",

    {
      "category": "Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Knowledge",
      "explanation": "The project descriptions suggest some familiarity with the software development lifecycle, covering design, development, and deployment. The use of Git and mentions of RESTful APIs indicate awareness of best practices. However, the CV does not explicitly mention any specific SDLC methodologies like Agile or Waterfall. Providing more details on the development process followed in each project and any experience with different SDLC approaches would improve this section.",

    {
      "category": "Adaptability and Continuous Learning",
      "explanation": "The variety of projects listed, including web and mobile applications, suggests some adaptability and willingness to learn new technologies. The mention of various frameworks and tools also indicates an interest in continuous learning. However, the CV doesn't explicitly highlight any specific instances of adapting to changing project requirements or proactively learning new skills. Including examples of how Khanh has overcome challenges in learning new technologies or adapting to changing priorities would strengthen this section.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Code Quality and Testing",
      "explanation": "The CV does not explicitly mention testing practices or code quality. While the project descriptions suggest development experience, there is no information on unit tests, code reviews, or adherence to coding standards. Including information on testing methodologies used and a commitment to writing clean, maintainable code would significantly improve this section.",
      "score": "2"

    {
      "category": "Database Knowledge",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions SQL (Postgres) and MongoDB, indicating database knowledge. The project descriptions also reference database usage. However, the depth of knowledge is unclear. More detail on database design, query optimization, and experience with ORM technologies would be beneficial.",

    },
    {
      "category": "Web Application Development",
      "explanation": "The CV showcases strong web application development experience with projects like the Ads Management Website and Booking Application. The use of React, Node.js, Express.JS, and RESTful APIs indicates proficiency in web frameworks and technologies. However, further detail on web application architecture and web security best practices would be valuable.",
