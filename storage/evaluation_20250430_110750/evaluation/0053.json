    {
      "category": "Technical Skills and Experience",
      "explanation": "The candidate possesses a variety of technical skills including MATLAB, LabView, SolidWorks, and Fritzing, which are relevant to engineering. Their experience includes projects involving hardware and software development. However, the CV lacks specific details related to software engineering, such as programming languages commonly used in software development, software testing methodologies, or experience with specific software development frameworks. The projects showcase technical aptitude but don't explicitly demonstrate skills in software engineering. The work experience as a peer tutor, while valuable, doesn't directly contribute to software engineering experience. Therefore, while there's a foundation of technical skills, the CV needs more focus on software-specific skills and experience to align better with a software engineering role.",
      "score": "5"
    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving and Analytical Skills",
      "explanation": "The projects listed demonstrate problem-solving skills through the design and prototyping of various devices. For example, the heart rate monitor and external fixator projects required the candidate to analyze problems, develop solutions, and test their effectiveness. However, the descriptions are relatively high-level and lack details on the specific analytical techniques or problem-solving methodologies used. The inclusion of simulation and testing in the external fixator project does show some analytical skills. Overall, there's evidence of problem-solving ability, but more detailed examples would strengthen this area.",

    {
      "category": "Communication and Collaboration Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate's work experience as a peer tutor showcases communication skills through assisting students, designing newsletters, and organizing events. The hearing aid project mentions delivering a presentation, which also demonstrates communication skills. The description of the tutor position also demonstrates collaboration. However, there's a lack of specific examples of teamwork in a software development context. Overall, the CV demonstrates communication skills in an academic setting, but it could benefit from examples of collaboration within a technical project or team.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Knowledge",
      "explanation": "The projects hint at some stages of the SDLC, such as design, prototyping, and testing. However, the CV lacks explicit mention of SDLC methodologies like Agile or Waterfall. There's no discussion of requirements gathering, version control, or deployment. Therefore, while the candidate has engaged in activities that are part of the SDLC, their understanding and experience with formal SDLC processes are unclear.",
      "score": "4"
    },
    {
      "category": "Adaptability and Continuous Learning",
      "explanation": "The candidate's ability to tutor in multiple subjects (mathematics, statistics, physics, and chemistry) suggests some level of adaptability. Furthermore, the utilization of digital platforms (Canva, Canvas, Zoom, TeamViewer, and Google applications) in the tutor role also indicates adaptability. However, the CV doesn't explicitly mention any efforts to learn new technologies or adapt to changing project requirements in a software engineering context. There's no mention of attending workshops, taking online courses, or contributing to open-source projects. Therefore, while there's some evidence of adaptability, the CV needs to demonstrate a stronger commitment to continuous learning in the field of software engineering.",

    {
      "category": "Code Quality and Testing",
      "explanation": "The CV mentions MATLAB and LabView, which involve coding, but there is no information about code quality or testing practices. The descriptions lack any mention of unit tests, code reviews, or adherence to coding standards. Without specific examples of coding projects and testing methodologies, it's difficult to assess the candidate's ability in this area.",
