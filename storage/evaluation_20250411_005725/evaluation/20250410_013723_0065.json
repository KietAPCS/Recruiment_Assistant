      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates experience with software and digital tools relevant to architecture and design, such as Rhinoceros, Grasshopper, Revit, AutoCAD, Adobe Creative Suite, and various fabrication technologies. However, there's no mention of core software engineering technologies like C#, .NET, SQL, SSRS, JavaScript, HTML, or CSS, which are crucial for this role. The experience in the Pratt Interdisciplinary Technology Lab is a strength, showcasing hands-on experience with digital fabrication equipment, but it doesn't directly translate to software engineering skills. The candidate's resume lacks evidence of formal software development experience, which is a significant weakness.",
