    {
      "category": "Technical Skills and Experience",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates a solid foundation in relevant technologies, particularly Java, Spring Boot, Next.js, JavaScript, and PostgreSQL. Their project experience showcases practical application of these technologies in developing e-commerce platforms. The CV provides links to GitHub repositories, allowing for verification of code quality and project scope. The candidate lists Typescript, which is a plus. However, the CV does not explicitly mention experience with C# or .NET, which are required technologies according to the job description. The experience seems heavily focused on Java and Javascript development.",
      "score": "7"
    },
    {
      "category": "Problem-Solving and Troubleshooting Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate's project descriptions include mention of optimizing server load efficiency and implementing security measures, which implies problem-solving abilities. The use of debounce for search functionality indicates an understanding of performance optimization. Mentioning specific achievements like reducing unauthorized access attempts by 75% strengthens this area. However, the CV lacks specific examples of troubleshooting complex technical issues or detailing a systematic approach to problem-solving beyond project features.",
      "score": "6"

    {
      "category": "Communication and Collaboration Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate's involvement in group projects and activities like WebDev Studio and UIT - ACM/ICPC BootCamp suggests some level of collaboration skills. The descriptions, however, lack concrete examples of effective communication or teamwork. The CV does not explicitly state how they communicated with team members or stakeholders or how they documented their work. More detail here would significantly improve this section.",

    {
      "category": "Adaptability and Learning Agility",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates a willingness to learn new technologies through their participation in workshops and self-study in algorithms and web development. The use of Next.js 14, Material UI, and other modern frameworks in their projects indicates adaptability. The CV mentions ongoing education, which is a positive sign. However, there's no explicit mention of how quickly they learn or adapt to changing priorities. Including examples of rapidly acquired skills would strengthen this assessment.",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Software Development Lifecycle Proficiency",
      "explanation": "The candidate's project experience covers aspects of the software development lifecycle, including design, development, and security implementation. The projects demonstrate a basic understanding of building web applications. However, the CV doesn't provide details on their experience with requirements gathering, testing methodologies, or deployment strategies. There's no explicit mention of SDLC methodologies used (Agile, Waterfall, etc.).",
      "score": "6"
    },
    {
      "category": "Code Quality and Testing",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates attention to code quality through the mention of optimized application security and custom annotations. However, the CV lacks specific information about testing methodologies used (unit testing, integration testing, etc.) or their debugging skills. The GitHub repositories can potentially offer insights into code quality, but this requires further investigation. The CV should include more details on code testing and quality assurance processes.",

    {
      "category": "Database Management Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate lists experience with MySQL and PostgreSQL, indicating a foundation in database technologies. The project descriptions imply experience with data modeling through the use of Spring Data JPA. However, the CV lacks specifics on their ability to write efficient SQL queries or perform database administration tasks. It is unclear how well they know ORM technologies.",

      "category": "Web Development Skills",
      "explanation": "The candidate demonstrates proficiency in web technologies through their use of Next.js, Material UI, DaisyUI, TailwindCSS, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project descriptions highlight the development of user interfaces and advanced search functionality. The CV presents evidence of responsive design. However, the candidate does not provide context to what depth these technologies are used.",

    },
    {
      "category": "Agile Development Experience",
      "explanation": "The CV does not explicitly mention experience with Agile development methodologies or participation in Scrum ceremonies. There is no mention of Agile principles. Therefore, it is difficult to assess their familiarity with Agile development.",

    {
      "category": "System Configuration and Support",
      "explanation": "The candidate's project descriptions focus primarily on development, with limited mention of system configuration or support. While security implementation can be considered a form of system configuration, the CV lacks explicit examples of troubleshooting system-related issues or providing technical support to users.",
