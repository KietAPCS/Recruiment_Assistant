# Package Folder (`pkg`)

The `pkg` folder contains modularized code and reusable components for the **Test Recruitment Assistant** project. Its purpose is to organize the core functionalities and libraries in a structured manner, ensuring maintainability and scalability.

## Contents

- **Core Modules**: Essential logic and utilities for the project.
- **Reusable Components**: Shared code used across different parts of the application.
- **Third-party Integrations**: Wrappers or extensions for external libraries or APIs.

## Guidelines

1. Keep the code modular and well-documented.
2. Follow consistent naming conventions.
3. Avoid adding application-specific logic here.

This structure helps maintain a clean and efficient codebase for the Hackathon 2025 project.
