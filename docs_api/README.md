# Folder Purpose: API Endpoint Testing

This folder is dedicated to testing the correctness and functionality of API endpoints. It contains scripts, test cases, and utilities designed to ensure that the API behaves as expected under various conditions. The primary objectives of this folder include:

- **Validation of API Responses**: Ensuring that the API returns the correct data, status codes, and headers for different requests.
- **Error Handling**: Verifying that the API handles invalid inputs, edge cases, and unexpected scenarios gracefully.
- **Performance Testing**: Assessing the response times and scalability of the API under different loads.
- **Integration Testing**: Testing the interaction between different API endpoints and their dependencies.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensuring that new changes or updates to the API do not break existing functionality.

This folder is an essential part of maintaining the reliability and robustness of the API.
