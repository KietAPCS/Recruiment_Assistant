Course description
Logic has been called the "calculus of computer science": just as sciences such as physics that
deal with continuous realm rely on calculus techniques, we rely on logic. Indeed, so many areas
of computer sciences are based on logic: from designing circuits to determining complexity of
problems; from verifying correctness of algorithms and devising database queries to automated
reasoning in artificial intelligence.
This course is intended to be an introduction to mathematical logic with emphasis on Computer
Science applications and methodologies. In particular, we will cover propositional and
predicate logic. Throughout the course, we will discuss semantics in logic together with basic
proof theory, again with computer science applications including proving algorithm
correctness. If time permitted, we will also discuss impossibility results, in particular Goedel's
incompleteness theorem.

Course description
This course provides a challenging introduction to some of the central ideas of theoretical
computer science. The course formalizes the notion of computation, using 3 models of
computation of increasing power: finite automata, push down automata, and Turing machines
- a kind of automata that can define all the languages that can reasonably be said to be definable
by any sort of computing device. The course also explains the relationship between these
models and different classes of languages: regular, context-free, Turing-decidable (or
recursive), and Turing-semidecidable (or recursively enumerable). These concepts form the
core of natural language processing, compiler design, speech recognition, theory of
programming languages, …

Course description
The course is designed to provide students fundamental knowledge of Artificial Intelligence
through the main unifying theme of an intelligent agent. We start with the formulation of AI
problems and how problem-solving agents find solutions to those problem using general-
purpose search algorithms.
We study different search strategies that facilitate myriad purposes of searching. Some
strategies work solely on the problem definition, while the others can do quite well given some
guidance on where to look for solutions. Advanced search problems that involve multiple
agents (adversarial search) or large state spaces usually need appropriate consideration, and
that leads to the need of studying adversarial search, local search, and constraint satisfaction
problem. The second part of the course study how to represent information in knowledge-based
agent, which is usually more flexible than the previous problem-solving agent. By separating
into the knowledge module and the inference module, this type of agent may adapt to the
changes of environment and tasks better. Propositional and first-order logic are helpful means
for bridging the gap of understandings between human and computers. Finally, a rational agent
could not be practical without the ability of improving their skills through experience. Students
spend the last weeks to learn basic machine learning to obtain the very first view of how an
intelligent agent can fully developed. Throughout the courses, students are encouraged to
strengthen their core skills, as well as soft skills, by solving several case studies, assignments,
and projects, either individually or in teamwork.
❖
Course goals
At the end of the course, students are able to
−
Discover the properties of the problem being considered and from that, choose
appropriate concepts and means in AI to formulate the problem
−
Differentiate various search strategies in term of algorithm complexity and information
exploited
−
Manipulate the knowledge-based agents by handing the knowledge bases and inference
algorithm using either propositional logic or first-order logic
−
Demonstrate simple learning agents that learn by observations
35

Hypothesize from observations and verify them through theoretical and/or empirical
evaluations

Course description
The course CS416 is an advanced course (at the end of Bachelor, or begin of Master studies)
in Information Modeling, Modeling Methodology, and Model Based Information Integration.
Modeling as well classical databases and information systems as well as highly heterogeneous
distributed information systems, in conjunction with dynamic (processes and behavior)
modeling approaches for these classes of information systems.
The foundations of modeling languages as well in formal semantics as also using
metamodelling approaches will be treated in detail. The given languages and our (meta-)
modeling methodology will be applied to practical examples of model-based integration of
software and data components for heterogeneous distributed information systems (HDIS) in
several business domains.
Therefore, the module covers all aspects of ‚model management‘ starting from model building
and modeling, via the formal foundations of modeling and metamodeling, via model
transformations and model integration (matching/merging), the persistent storage of (meta-)
models in model repositories to, finally, the handling of consistency and evolution of models
and metamodels.
❖
Course goals
At the end of the course, students are able to
−

techniques and the modeling methodology for complex information modeling tasks by
understanding the foundations of modeling languages (semantics and metamodeling
approaches) and modeling methodology (course objective #1)
−
Apply modeling and metamodeling techniques in the variety of process modeling,
structure & information modeling and modeling of knowledge/constraints for
information management, information integration and business intelligence solutions
(course objective #2)
−

It turns out that there is the same answer to those questions. The successful companies know
that they need to delight users with their products. Not frustrating them. They know the right
Human-Computer Interaction principles, processes, and techniques to apply. Not being
ignorant of them.
If you miss this course, you’ll miss out on how to efficiently come up with product ideas, to
rapidly prototype multiple alternatives, to design beautiful interfaces, and to verify whether
users like them. Among other things!

Course description
This course emphasizes teamwork in small groups on a substantial project that will be
performed for a real customer. Projects are chosen to provide interdisciplinary content with
project proposals being solicited from the community at large. Projects that involve students
as well as customers from other disciplines are encouraged. Lectures will be directed towards
the management of software development projects such as those being carried out by the teams.
It is the intent of the course to provide a capstone experience that integrates the material
contained in the remainder of the CS curriculum through work on a project that applies this
material in another discipline. Each team member will contribute to the design, documentation,
and testing phases of the project. This course creates an obligation for participation for two
consecutive quarters.
❖

Demonstrate a professional attitude
−
Demonstrate the ability to integrate the different disciplines required
−
Communicate effectively with clients and sponsors
−
Communicate effectively in both written work and in group situations
−
Effectively manage, monitor, and control the activities involved in a development
project
−
Determine an appropriate process and accompanying set of deliverables for their
project
−
Show the ability to document appropriately the deliverables for their project - software
specifications, project plans, source code, technical reports…
−
Select and justify an appropriate methodology for their project
−
Demonstrate a professional attitude

Course content
Initially, the Capstone class will have a structure like that of most other classes. Saturday
morning meetings will consist of lecture and class interaction. The goal of these lectures will
be to help reinforce students' knowledge of commonly accepted software engineering and
project management practices. However, by the second term of the Capstone Sequence, the
structure of the course will have morphed to something unlike any other course you have taken
here. A major goal of the Capstone is to accustom you to a corporate team environment, where
responsibility for getting things done belongs to the team and its members.
Each team will arrange a regular half hour status meeting with the Instructor each week. This
will provide some visibility into team performance, dynamics, and effort invested by individual
team members. In addition, the status meetings will ensure that each team makes steady,
consistent progress towards completing the project.
